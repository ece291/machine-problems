<h2>Introduction</h2>

As mentioned in the 
<a href="../../class-information/overview.html">Course Syllabus</a>,
an ECE291 grade is determined by the following components: 
machine problems (40%), homeworks (10%), examination 1 (15%), 
examination 2 (15%), and the final examination (20%).
<p>
The computation of ECE291 scores are based on a 1000-point system.
A student's <i>total score</i> is computed 
as the sum of the raw points
earned on the machine problems, exams, and final plus 
one-fourth (1/4) of the sum of the raw points earned on the homework.
<p>
The breakdown of points for each assignment is
shown in the table below.  MP6 refers to the final group project at
the end of the semester.

<h2>Problem Description</h2>
For this machine problem, you will write a program which converts
a list of raw scores from ECE291 homeworks, machine problems, exams, and
final exam into a sorted list of class standings.  
<p>
The list of raw scores will be given to you in the form of a <i>database</i>.
For ECE291, our database is collection
of records that each hold a student ID and individual raw scores.  
The ID is an alpha-numeric string stored as 5 ASCII characters
and terminated with a '$' symbol.  Each of the 16 individual raw scores is
stored as a 1-byte unsigned integer.  The <i>total score</i> is
represented as a 2-byte unsigned integer.  In total, each ECE291 record
occupies 24 bytes.  
<h2>Record Format</h2>
The record format of the ECE291 database is
summarized below.  In this table 'A' represents an ASCII character,
'$' represents the ASCII character used to mark the end of a string,
'B' represents a 1-byte unsigned integer, and 'WW' represents a 2-byte
unsigned integer.  The <i>offset</i> refers to the starting 
location of each field in each 24-byte array.

<p>
For this machine problem, you will use the INCLUDE directive to read
a database of fictitious ECE291 scores into your program.  
This directive will insert the contents of the file called 
<tt>gbk.dta</tt> into your .ASM program at the time you run MASM.
The <tt>gbk.dta</tt> file defines a variable called <tt>gbk</tt> which holds 
the entire database as well as a variable called <tt>numrec</tt> which 
stores the number of records in the database.  The contents of
<tt>gbk.dta</tt> is shown below:
<p>
<center><table border=1 cellpadding=3><tr><td><pre>
gbk db 'PERFT','$',24,75,75,75,75,76, 25,50,50,50,50,75,100, 150,150, 200,0,0
    db '12345','$',24,75,70,65,70,65, 25,50,40,45,40,75, 80, 125,125, 133,0,0
    db 'MEETO','$',20,60,75,70,65,76, 25,45,45,50,45,70, 90, 110,140, 140,0,0
    db 'YOUTO','$', 0,75,65,75,75,72,  0,50,45,50,45,75, 95, 130,135, 150,0,0
    db 'HLPME','$', 2, 4, 4, 8, 6, 8,  5,10,10,15,10, 5, 10,  50, 50,  75,0,0

numrec dw 5 ; Number of records (5 in this case)
</pre></table></center>
<p>
Notice that the record with id=<tt>MEETO</tt> begins at a byte offset of
24x2=48 in the array.  
The homework zero score for this record is located at offset 
24x2+6=54.  The total score (which you will need to compute) for this
record is defined at offset 24x2+22=70.

<h2>Preliminary Procedure</h2>
<ul>
<li>You may copy the empty MP1.ASM assignment and example database
    file (GBK.DTA) from the network drive to your home directory
    with the following command: <br>
    <tt>xcopy /s E:\ece291\mp1 F:\mp1</tt>
</ul>

<h2>Program Assignment</h2>
<ol>
<li>Calculate the <i>total score</i> for each record in the database.  <br>
    <ul>
    <li>Write a main loop that 
        computes the <i>total score</i> for each record in the database
        using the method described in the introduction.
    <li>Note that scores are stored in the array as 8-bit integers,
        but that 16-bit addition is needed to compute the sum.
        (8-bit addition would not allow students to score more than 255 points!)
    <li>Recall that division by powers of 2 
        can be accomplished by shift operations
    <li>Note that an inner loop can be used to perform the addition 
        of fields within each record.
    </ul>
<li>Write another loop which prints out each record, sorted in order of
    decreasing scores.
    <ul>
    <li>Hint: A simple (though inefficient) way to sort this database
        scans the <i>total score</i> of each record 1000 times.
        On each iteration, print the record if the 
        <i>total score</i> equals the value of the iteration. 
        Begin at 1000.
     <li>I have provided a library function called <tt>printrec</tt>
        in the file <tt>LIBMP1.LIB</tt>.
        This subroutine prints all fields of the record starting at
        the location specified by register DX.  You may use this
        library subroutine by issuing the following command 
        to link your program <br>
        <tt>LINK MP1,,,LIB291/MAP+LIBMP1/MAP;</tt>
    </ul>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>NOTE: Your program must work for a database with
    arbitrary content and number of records.  
    When you turn in your program,
    it will be recompiled using a database file
    different from the example provided in the assignment.
</ul>

<h2>Final Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Demonstrate MP1.EXE to a TA or to the instructor.  
    You will
    then be asked to recompile and demonstrate 
    MP1 with a different database file.
    Once approved, you are ready to turn in your program.
<li>Copy your programs to a floppy: <br>
    <tt>xcopy /s F:\mp1 a:\mp1</tt>
<li>Print MP1.ASM 
<li>Take your printout and disk with MP1 to the same TA which approved your 
    demonstration.  Be sure that your name is on the disk and on the printout.  
</ol>
