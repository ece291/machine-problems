<h2>Introduction</h2>
In this machine problem you will add a 3-dimensional view of the 
MP3 maze that allows viewing the maze from the point-of-view of the mouse
in the maze.
<p>
The following diagram is a screen-dump of the running program:
<p>
<center><img src="maze3dview.gif" width="637" height="312"></center>
<p>
The internal representation of the maze is the same as it was for MP3.
The following diagram is a screen-dump of the corresponding view 
on the 2-dimensional maze.
<p>
<center><img src="maze3d2d.gif" width="262" height="176"></center>
<p>
The mouse is looking West.  Note that there is a hallway to the right
and two hallways to the left.
<p>

<hr>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
A 3D perspective can be implemented by placing
a vanishing point in the center of the screen.
Objects at an infinite depth would be located in the center of the screen
and have a height of zero.  
Objects at each depth 
become larger by scaling their size by a constant. 
<p>
Rectangular objects can be represented by drawing simple geometric shapes
that follow the diagnonal, horizontal, or vertical guidelines.  A back
wall, for example, can be represented by a rectangle.  A sidewall can
be represented by a trapezoid.
<p>
To avoid time-consuming multiplication, arrays can be defined that 
contain pre-calculated positions and sizes of an object 
at each depth.  Due to the limited resolution of a video screen
these arrays can be small.  Once the size of an object is less 
than the size of a pixel, there is no purpose in plotting it on the screen.
<p>
<center><img src="maze3dpositions.gif" width="574" height="325"></center>
<p>
For this machine problem, we will be using a screen resolution of 320x200
pixels.  At this resolution, it is possible to render full-motion
video (30 frames-per-second) on a Pentium-class computer (such as those
in our lab).  Two arrays will be defined at this resolution:
one to hold pixel coordinates and the other to hold object sizes.
The sizes of the arrays are defined by the constant MAXDepth3d.
The array <tt>p3d</tt> holds the top-left position of a 3D element 
at each depth.  The array <tt>x3d</tt> holds the size of a 3D element.
To nearly fill the screen and preserve simple X/Y scaling values; we 
will choose an aspect ratio of 2:1.  The diagram above shows the
coordinates and size of a back wall and two side walls at a given depth.
<p>
The rendering algorithm begins from the most distant point down
the hallway.  At this depth, a rectangle is drawn to represent
the back wall.  At each decreasing depth level, rectangles and
trapezoids are drawn to represent ceilings, floors, walls,
and hallway openings.  
<p>
The 3-D routines of MP4 interface to MP3 by a single procedure.
UpdateGRScreen is called instead of UpateTextScreen when
the program is in graphics mode.  Maze elements are drawn
by looking down a hallway in the direction that the mouse is facing.
This machine problem is limited to displaying mazes
with hallways that are no more than one unit wide.
<hr>
<h2>Changes to MP3</h2>
Other than the 3D rendering, only a few enhancements were made to 
the existing code of MP3.  
<ul>
  <li>In 2D mode, it is now possible to see the direction of the mouse.  
  <li>The keyboard was redefined to mean: forward, back, turn left, turn right.
  <li>UpdateScreen calls UpdateTextScreen or
      UpdateGRScreen, depending on the VidMode.
  <li>It is possible to toggle the status decision points by pressing 'v'.
  <li>It is possible to walk away from a node once AutoSolve finishes.
  <li>You can abort AutoSolve by pressing any key
  <li>You can load other mazes by typing 'mazec filename'
  <li>You can invoke the _TestGeometry routine by typing 'mazec test'
</ul>
<p>
You are <i>encouraged</i> to use your MP3 routines in MP4.  
There is, however, <i>no penalty</i> for using library versions 
of the MP3 procedures.

<h2>Procedures</h2>
<ul>
<li><font size=+2><b>DrawBox</b></font><p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> Draw a filled rectangular box on the screen.
  <li><b>Inputs</b>
    <ul>
    <li>DX: Starting Position of box (specified as offset from zero)
    <li>CX: Width of box (number of horizontal pixels)
    <li>BX: Height of box (number of vertical pixels)  
    <li>AL: Color
    </ul>
  <li><b>Outputs:</b> Writes to screen
  <li><b>Registers:</b> Preserves any that are modified
  <li><b>Assumptions:</b> The width of the box is a multiple of two.
  <li><b>Notes:</b> Invoking the main program as 'mazec test' will call
     the _TestGeometry routine.  
  <li><b>Description</b>:<p>
     This routine draws a filled rectangular box on the screen.  The
     starting position is determined by DX.  DX is specified as 
     an offset from the starting location of the video page
     (i.e., DX=320*y + x).  You may optimize your code with the assumption
     that the width will always be a multiple of two (i.e., an even number).
     <p>

  </ul>
<p>
<li><font size=+2><b>DrawTrap</b></font><p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> Draw a filled trapezoid on the screen
  <li><b>Inputs:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>DX: Starting Position of trapezoid (specified as offset from zero)
    <li>CX: Width of box (number of horizontal pixels)
    <li>BX: Height of box (number of vertical pixels)  
    <li>AL: Color
    <li>AH: Direction (0=Left, 1=Right)
    </ul>
  <li><b>Outputs:</b> Writes to screen
  <li><b>Registers:</b> Preserves any that are modified
  <li><b>Assumptions:</b> The width of the trapezoid is a multiple of two.
  <li><b>Notes:</b> Invoking the main program as 'mazec test' will call
     the _TestGeometry routine.  
  <li><b>Description:</b> <p>
     There are two types of trapezoids that we need to draw for this
     machine problem -- Left-sided and Right-sided.  This subroutine should
     perform either as determined by the value in AH.  The starting position
     refers to the top-corner of the object, as shown below.  The height
     refers to the total height of the object.  The slanted lines for this
     routine will have a fixed slope of 2:1, i.e., the line advances two 
     horizontal pixels for each vertical pixel.  The sloped line continues
     until the object has reached full width.

<p>
<li><font size=+2><b>DrawBackWall</b></font><p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose</b>: Draw the solid wall at the end of a hallway.
  <li><b>Input</b>: SI: Depth of Wall 
  <li><b>Outputs:</b> Writes to screen 
  <li><b>Registers:</b> Preserves any that are modified
  <li><b>Uses:</b> DrawBox, p3d, x3d
  <li><b>Constants:</b> REDBR
  <li><b>Description:</b> <p>
    The back wall is a rectangular box in the center of the screen
    that represents the wall at the end of the hallway.  
    The depth (SI) of the wall refers to the distance between
    the position of the mouse and the location of the wall.
    As the mouse moves further from a wall, the size of the wall
    decreases.
   <p>
    The size and position of the box can be calculated as 
    a function of the depth (SI), the position array (<tt>p3d</tt>), and the 
    size array (<tt>x3d</tt>).  
    Note that the back wall is located at one depth greater than the value 
    of SI. The color of the back wall should be bright red 
    (as defined by the constant: REDBR).  
  </ul>
   <p>

<li><font size=+2><b>DrawSides</b></font><p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose</b>: Draw sides of the hallway to represent walls or openings
     at a given depth.
  <li><b>Input</b>: SI: Depth of Wall 
  <li><b>Outputs:</b> Writes to screen 
  <li><b>Registers:</b> Preserves any that are modified
  <li><b>Uses:</b> DrawBox, DrawTrap, p3d, x3d, Side3d[SI]
  <li><b>Constants:</b> RED, REDBR, LSW, RSW
  <li><b>Description:</b> <p>
     This routine draws the walls or openings along the left and right
     sides of the hallway at a given depth (SI).  If there is a wall along
     a side, this routine will draw a red trapezoid.  
     If there is an opening,
     the routine will draw a bright-red (REDBR) rectangle.  The presence of
     a sidewall can be determined by testing the value of Side3d[SI] with
     LSW and RSW.  
     <p>
     The sidewalls appear trapezoidal because of the 3D perspective.
     The side of wall closer to the mouse appears larger than the side of 
     the wall that is further.  The absolute size and position of the sidewalls
     is determined as a function of the position and size arrays
     (<tt>p3d</tt> and <tt>x3d</tt>).  
     Recall that
     the position of a right-trapezoid is given by the location of its
     top-right corner.
     <p>
     Openings appear as narrow rectangles because the
     the mouse views them from at a head-on perspective.  As with the back wall,
     they are colored bright-red to indicate direct illumination.
     Because hallways are limited to a single-unit width, it is not 
     necessary to extend the width of an opening to the far side of the screen.
     It is safe to assume that the sidewall at the next level (SI-1) will
     draw on that region of the screen.
  </ul>
  <p>
<li><font size=+2><b>DrawFloorCeiling</b></font><p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> Draw ceiling and floor at a given depth.
  <li><b>Inputs:</b> SI: Depth 
  <li><b>Outputs:</b> Writes to screen
  <li><b>Registers:</b> Preserves any that are modified
  <li><b>Uses:</b> DrawBox, p3d, x3d, View3d[SI]
  <li><b>Constants:</b> GRAY, BLUE, GREEN, RED, YELLOW
  <li><b>Description:</b><p>
     The "ceiling" refers to the blue sky above the maze.  
     The "floor" refers to the gray concrete tile on the ground.
     This routine draws two narrow horizontal rectangles to represent
     the visable portion of these elements at depth SI.
     <p>
     To represent colored decision points and the endpoint of the maze,
     crosshairs may be drawn on the floor.  If the value of View3d[SI]
     is DECPOS, VISPOS, FINPOS, or ENDPOS, a BLUE, GREEN, RED, or YELLOW
     crosshair should be drawn on the screen.  
     The width of the crosshair should be one-half that of 
     the width of the floor tile.  The height of the crosshair should be
     the full hight of the floor tile.
  </ul>
<p>
<li><font size=+2><b>DrawGRScreen</b></font><p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> Draw the graphic screen 
  <li><b>Inputs:</b> SI: Maximum Depth 
  <li><b>Uses:</b> DrawBackWall, DrawFloorCeiling, DrawSides 
  <li><b>Registers:</b> Preserves any that are modified
  <li><b>Description:</b><p>
    Now that you can draw walls, ceilings, floors, sidewalls, and openings,
    it is surprisingly simple the draw the entire graphics screen.  Starting
    at the depth of the furthest wall (given by SI), this routine first draws 
    the back wall then draws then calls DrawFloorCeiling and DrawSides for
    represent the view at each depth closer to the mouse.  Upon finishing
    this routine at depth=0, the entire screen should be filled with
    the 3d view of a hallway.  
    <p>
    For testing purposes, you may wish to test your routines by initializing
    View3d and Side3d with sample values, setting SI to the depth of your
    hallway, and calling this routine.
  </ul>
<p>
<li><font size=+2><b>UpdateGRScreen</b></font><p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> Interface to existing maze program
  <li><b>Inputs:</b> DI=current position maze, AL=current direction
  <li><b>Modifieds/Uses:</b> View3d[], Side3d[], w3d[], DrawGRScreen
  <li><b>Registers:</b> Preserves any that are modified
  <li><b>Constants:</b> MAXDepth3d, LSW, RSW
  <li><b>Description:</b><p>
    This procedure is the 3d-equivalent of UpdateTextScreen.  
    This single routine is the interface between the existing code in MP3
    and the new 3d view created by this machine problem.
    As before (with UpdateTextScreen), DI holds the current position in _MAZE 
    and AL holds the current direction.  
    <p>
    By examinging the contents of _MAZE in the direction of AL, this routine
    fills in the values of the arrays View3d[] and Side3d[].  This routine
    first loads View3d[0] with _MAZE[DI].  For each value of _MAZE in
    the direction of AL, View3d is loaded with the value in _MAZE until 
    hitting a wall or reaching MAXDepth3d (a constant which determines
    how far the mouse can see).  
    <p>
    For each element in the View3d array, a corresponding byte is stored in 
    Side3d array.  The Side3d array refers to whether or not the element
    to the left or right of the maze contains a wall or a opening (a hallway).
    Each element of Size3d should be initialized to zero.  
    If there is a
    wall to the left of the current position, 
    the element in Side3d should be OR'd with the constant
    LSW (Left-Side-Wall).
    Likewise, if there is a
    wall to the right, the element in Side3d should be OR'd with 
    the constant RSW (Right-Side-Wall).
    <p>
    Now that the views have been initialized, set SI to the depth of
    the furthest wall (or MAXDepth3d if you are looking down a really long
    hallway) and call UpdateGRScreen to finish your machine problem.

<h2>Points</h2>
You earn points by replacing each subroutine with your own code.
Your score will be proportional to the percentage of the code that
your write yourself.  The breakdown in points is given below.  Your
routine MUST perform all functions of the subroutine to receive credit.
<p>
You are urged to test each routine as you write it.  It is nearly
impossible to debug a program if there are errors in the routines 
that it calls.  Note that library routines always call other library
routines.  You need to call your routines directly to verify their
functionality.
<p>
You are encouraged to <i>start early</i>.  There will be a 15-point
checkpoint on Thursday, November 14.  At this point, you will earn up to 
15 points for already-completed routines.  On the deadline, you 
can earn the remaining 35 points.
<p>
You are encouraged to
write efficient code using the techniques studied in this class
(such as table lookups and fast string operations).  
You can earn two points by demonstrating that your program, in graphics mode,
at delay=0 can use AutoSolve to find the solution as fast as or faster than
Lockwood's code (recall that the library code purposefully contains 
extraneous code).
You will earn 1 point if your code is <i>no</i> more than 25% slower.
Benchmarks will be done in the lab
using the Pentium computers at the time you demonstrate your MP.

<h2>Starting Files</h2> 
You will begin MP3 with the following files:
<ul>
<li><b><a href="mazec.exe">MAZEC.EXE</a></b>: A fully functional executable 
  program using library routines 
<li><b><a href="maze.dta">MAZE.DTA</a></b>: The maze definition file.

    <tt>MAZE.DTA</tt>, determines the decision points, stores the
    data in <tt>_MAZE</tt>, and initiates the program.
    <i>(You shouldn't need to modify this program)</i>
<li><b>MAZE3D.ASM</b>: 
  A starting point for the program.  You are given
  the routines for reading and processing keyboard input, calling
  the other functions, delaying movement, and interfacing with the
  C program.
    <i>(Add your routines here and comment out the EXTRN lines)</i>
<li><b>MAKE.BAT</b>: A short batch program which compiles, assembles, and links
  the programs.
