<h2>Introduction</h2>
Calculators were one of the greatest gifts to the engineer this century.  
They eliminated the tedious work of calculating numeric results.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) innovated a method of calculation called
RPN (Reverse Polish Notation).  
<p>
RPN employs a stack to hold numbers
and intermediate results.  When a number is entered, it is PUSHed to the
stack.  When an operation is entered, it POPs element(s) from the stack,
performs the calculation, and PUSHes the result back to the stack.
With RPN, there is no need for parenthese or equal buttons.
<p>
Using RPN, the equation <i>X+(Y*Z)</i> can be computed by entering 
the following keystrokes:<p>
<table border=1 cellpadding=3><tr><Td>
 X <i>[enter]</i>
 Y <i>[enter]</i>
 Z <i>[enter]</i>
 * <i>[enter]</i>
 + <i>[enter]</i>
</table><p>
For this example, X, Y, and Z were pushed to the stack.  When the
multiplication command was entered (*); the values Y and Z were POPed
from the stack, Y*Z was computed, and this product (YZ) was PUSHed back
to the stack.  When the addition command was entered (+), X and
YZ were POPed from the stack, X+YZ was computed, and this sum was pushed
back to the stack.  The final result is stored at the top of the stack.

<h2>Problem Description</h2>
For this machine problem, you will implement the core functionality
of a RPN calculator.  Your calculator will compute results
on 16-bit integer values.  It will read and print results 
in binary, decimal, or hex.  It will support
all standard logical and mathematical operations, including the
computation of factorials.  

<ul>
<li><b>Internal Storage</b> <br>
  All Numbers are internally stored as 16-bit signed integers
  using 2's complement notation. 
  16-bit words are PUSHed and POPed to and from the stack.
  For this machine problem, you may assume that the user will never
  POP more words from the stack than were PUSHed.  
  <p><i>Note that
  we are also using the stack when we call procedures.   A 16-bit
  Instruction Pointer (IP) is pushed to the stack whenever a 
  NEAR procedure is called. </i>
  <p>
<li><b>ModeDisp</b><br>
  The <i>ModeDisp</i> variable determines 
  how numbers are entered and displayed.  
  For binary and hex mode, negative 
  numbers are displayed in their 2's complement representation.
  <p>
  In decimal mode, negative numbers are displayed in the more
  traditional format.  Negative numbers are preceded by the '-' sign.
  You may find the BINASC routine in LIB291 useful for displaying
  numbers in the decimal mode.
  <p>
  Negative numbers will not entered directly.  Instead,
  you may assume that the user will enter a positive number then use
  the negation command.
  <p>
  Modes can be changed while the calculator is running by entering
  the commands MB, MD, MH (ModeBin, ModeDecimal, ModeHex).  The
  <i>ModeDisp</i> variable stores the current mode of the calculator.
  By default, the calculator should operate in decimal mode.
  <p>
  The value of the <i>ModeDisp</i> variable and the commands
  to switch modes are summarized below. <p>
  <table border=1 cellpadding=3>
  <tr><th>ModeDisp</th><th>CMD</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>2 <td>MB <td>Binary Mode: (0,1): 2's complement </tr>
  <tr><td>10<td>MD <td>Decimal Mode: (0..9): 
         Negative numbers indicated with '-' </tr>
  <tr><td>16<td>MH <td>Hex Mode: (0..9..A..F): 2's complement </tr>
  </table><p>
<li><b>Operations</b><br>
  Operations may take either one or two operands from the stack,
  perform the operation, then push the result back to the stack.
  Let S0 refer to the element at the top of the stack, and
  S1 refer to the next element on the stack.
  <p>
  Single-operand instruction (such as negation) POPs the first element from
  the stack (S0), performs the operation, then PUSHes the result back to
  the stack as S0. 
  Two-operand instructions (such as addition) POPs the first two elements
  from the stack (S1 and S0), performs the operation, then PUSHes the
  result back to the stack as S0.   <p>

</ul>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
For this program, you will write three modular procedures.  
<ul>
<li><b>ReadInput</b><br>
  <ul>
  <li>Inputs: Register DI points to the 2-byte variable <i>ModeDisp</i>
  <li>Outputs: Register BH indicates which command (if any) was entered.
  <li>Notes: All other registers are undefined.  Register DI should
      not be modified (only the value pointed to by DI should
      be modified).
  </ul> <p>
  This subroutine reads the input from the keyboard.  You may
  use the KBDINE routine from LIB291 to read in the ASCII
  characters.  
  Input can be numbers, operation commands, or mode commands. 
  Input may include a comments, which is indicated by a semicolon.
  Your program should ignore all spaces (' '), LineFeeds (LF), as well
  as ALL characters following the ';' (comments). 
  <p> 
  <ul>
  <li>If a number is
  entered, the value should be converted from Binary, Decimal, or hex
  (depending on the value of <i>DispMode</i>) and pushed to the stack.
  An example input (in hex) is "5FF".  You should ignore any extra
  spaces entered from the keyboard and zero-pad numbers if necessary.
  The register BH should be set to one.  Hint: You will need 
  to manipulate the stack to insert the number <i>before</i> the
  return address of the subroutine.
  <li>If a mode command is entered ("MB", "MD", or "MH"), you should 
  update the variable <i>DispMode</i> to (2, 10, or 16).  
  The register BH should be set to zero.
  <li>If an operation is entered, the ASCII code for the command should
  be return in BH.  The special commands: ESC (the escape key) and
  'Q' are used to quit the program.  Values of BH include:
  ('+','-','*','/','%','!','&','|','^','~','Q', and ESC) 
</ul> <p>
<li><b>DispOutput</b><br>
  <ul>
  <li>Inputs: Register DI points to the 2-byte variable <i>ModeDisp</i>
  <li>Outputs: None 
  <li>Notes: All other registers are undefined.  Register DI should
      not be modified 
  </ul> <p>
  This routine is called to print the value at the top of the stack
  in the appropriate MODE (as selected by <i>ModeByte</i>).  You may use
  the BINASC and DSPMSG routines from LIB291.  You will need to 
  write your own code to display binary or hex values.
  <p> 
<li><b>Calculate</b><br>
  <ul>
  <li>Input: Register BH indicates which command (if any) was entered.
       If BH does not contain a valid math or logical command, 
       this routine should not perform any function.
  <li>Output: None
  <li>Notes: All other registers are undefined.  Register DI should
      not be modified.
  </ul> <p>
  This routine POPs one or two elements from the stack, performs 
  the operation given by the ASCII command in BH 
  and PUSHes the result back to the stack.  You will need to
  manipulate the stack in order to retrive and push elements
  without affecting the IP that was pushed when the subroutine
  was called
</ul>

<h2>Program Assignment</h2>
  You will begin this machine problem with a fully functional 
  program.  The main program is given below.  I have provided the
  library routines for each of the three procedures above.  You will
  score points by replacing the library procedures with your own code.
  Your score will be proportional to the percentage of the code
  that you write yourself.  The breakdown in points is given below:
  Your routine MUST perform all functions of the subroutine to 
  obtain credit.
  <ul>
  <li>ReadInput: 20 points
  <li>DispOutput: 15 points
  <li>Calculate: 15 points
  </ul>

<h2>Preliminary Procedure</h2>
<ul>
<li>You may copy the empty MP2.ASM assignment, sample input,
    sample output, and library files from the network drive 
    to your home directory
    with the following command: <br>
    <tt>xcopy /s E:\ece291\mp2 F:\mp2</tt>
<li>You can link the program (with my libraries) with the following
    command: <Br>
    <tt>link mp2,,,LIB291/MAP+LIBMP2/MAP;</tt>
<li>Once you have written all library functions on your own,
    you can link your program as follows:
    <tt>link mp2,,,LIB291/MAP;</tt>
</ul>


<h2>Final Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Demonstrate MP2.EXE to a TA or to the instructor.  
    You will be asked to recompile and demonstrate 
    MP2 with a set of inputs that exercises all functions of
    the calculator.  
<li>You will need to show which of the three
    functions you implemented, and which of the three functions
    you used from MP2LIB.  
<li>You will be asked to run your calculator with
    the input file MP2.IN by executing the following command.<Br>
    <xmp>MP2 < MP2.IN </xmp><tr>
    The output should match MP2.OUT.
<li>You will be asked to run your calculator with
    another input file to verify that no numbers or
    results are hardcoded into your program.
<li>Have the TA execute the handin program from your machine.
<li>Print MP2.ASM and give it to  
    to the same TA which approved your 
    demonstration.  Be sure that your name is the printout.
