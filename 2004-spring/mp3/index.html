<H2>Introduction</H2>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="mp3.jpg" width="652" height="331"></p>
<p>Conway's Game of Life is not that crappy board game you probably played as a 
child.&nbsp; It's a cellular automaton invented by Cambridge mathematician John 
Conway.&nbsp; The rules of the game are simple:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><b>For a cell that is 'occupied' or 'populated':</b></dt>
  <dd>Each cell with one or no neighbors dies in the next generation because of
    loneliness.
  <dd>Each cell with four or more neighbors dies in the next generation because
    of overpopulation.
  <dd>Each cell with two or three neighbors survives in the next generation.
  <dt><b>For a cell that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated':</b><dd>Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated in the next generation .</dd>
</dl>
<P>In this MP, you'll create a version of Conway's Game of Life.&nbsp; You will
be obtaining user input through asynchronous I/O and writing interrupt handlers
to process the input.&nbsp; You'll also display the game board with text mode
video.</P>
<H2>Problem Description</H2>
<h3>Program Variables</h3>
<p>The game board is modeled as a 25 row by 40 column array.&nbsp; There are two
game boards: <i>CurrentBoard </i>contains the current generation and <i>
NextBoard </i>contains the next generation.&nbsp; There are two possible values 
for the locations in the game board: a 0 corresponds to an empty cell, and a 1 
corresponds to an occupied cell.&nbsp; The border rows and columns of <i>
CurrentBoard</i> should be ignored when
calculating the next generation.</p>
<p align="left">The <i>MPFlags</i> variable contains the status flags that are 
used in the MP.&nbsp; It is a waste of space to create separate variables for 
each of the status flags; the values of the flags will always be either 0 or 1, 
so we can use a bit to represent the flag instead of a byte.&nbsp; The following 
bullets describe how each bit in <i>MPFlags</i> is used.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bit 0 - End Game</li>
  <li>Bit 1 - Calculate Next Generation</li>
  <li>Bit 2 - Auto-Calculate Next Generation</li>
  <li>Bit 3 - Left Mouse Button Status (High if Held Down)</li>
</ul>
<p>You should familiarize yourself with the logical instructions so that you're 
able to set, clear, or toggle one or more bits of a byte.</p>
<h3>Text Mode Video</h3>
<p>Section 11.1 of the lab manual discusses text mode video.&nbsp; In this MP, 
you'll be writing directly to video memory.&nbsp; The lab manual has examples on 
how to do this.&nbsp; Recall that the first page of
video memory begins at segment B800h.&nbsp; &nbsp; Also, the colors you'll be working with in the MP are defined
for you as constants, and the lookup table <i>ColorTable</i> has also been
provided for your convenience.</p>
<p>Double buffering is a technique used to eliminate screen flicker.&nbsp; If you've ever
played any old-school Nintendo games, you most likely seen the screen flicker
occasionally.&nbsp; With double buffering, you create a buffer equal to the size
of the video memory screen buffer (we'll call this buffer <i>ScreenBuffer</i>), draw the next frame to the temporary buffer,
then copy the entire temporary buffer to video memory when you're ready to
update the screen.&nbsp; This process allows for smooth transitions between 
frames, which solves the flicker problem.</p>
<h3>Asynchronous I/O</h3>
<p>In previous MPs, we used the library's kbdin/kbdine functions to get
keyboard input. These functions continuously polled the keyboard until they received
input. In many cases, we want our programs to accept input from other devices
and/or execute other functions while waiting for user input. This is done by
writing our own interrupt service routines (ISRs). For this MP, we will be
obtaining user input from the keyboard and mouse asynchronously.  We'll also be using the system timer to automatically calculate the next generation of the current game board every second.</p>
<H2>MP3 Program Assignment</H2>
<P>You will replace these 
	procedures from the LIBMP3 library by commenting out the statements calling the 
	library procedure and adding your code. Each procedure that you write should 
	match the output of the library code exactly. Each of the function calls and 
	their functionality is described below in the <b>Subroutines</b> section. The 
	best way to get a feel for the program is to run it to see how it is supposed 
	to operate. You can also edit the test file to see how various changes will 
	affect the program execution.&nbsp; The program can be run by typing <TT>mp3</TT> 
at the command prompt.</P>

<H2>Subroutines</H2>
<P>This assignment has 14 subroutines. You will receive credit by replacing each 
	of these 14 subroutines listed below with your own code.

		The LIBMP3 file contains executable library functions for each of the routines 
		that you need to implement. This allows you to run the program and understand 
		how it works before you implement it. You can test your program with any 
		combinations of your own code and library functions. You will only receive 
		credit, however, for the routines that you implement yourself.
		<BR>
	<LI>
		When debugging your code in TD, you will find it helpful to use the memory 
		window to show you the memory location of the file and strings. You can also 
		use the watch window to keep track of variables in your code.<BR>
	<LI>
		Do not assume that the file starts at memory location 0.
