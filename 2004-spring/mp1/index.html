    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>As engineers, you all know how important it is to manage your time.
    Sometimes, however, even good engineers get swamped with classes, work,
    due dates, and other obligations.  In this machine problem, you'll help
    tackle this problem by making a single day planner that schedules and
    lists all the tasks for each day in its database.</p>
    <h2>Problem Description</h2>
    <p>Your program is required to: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Read items from a calendar database in the specified format.</li>
      <li>Match items to a specific day of the week (Monday - Friday).</li>
      <li>Insert items into the day-long schedule, being sure not to double-book a time slot.</li>
      <li>Calculate statistics for each day's activities.</li>
      <li>Disaply the completed schedule and statistics.</li>
    </ul>
	<p>
	In our implementation of the schedule maker, there are a few key things to know:
	<ul><b> <li>Strings</b><br>
	In assembly, strings are just a series of bytes of ASCII characters.
	The lib291 string-display function, dspmsg, uses a '$' character to mark
	the end of a string. For example, the string 'ECE291$' would be a
	seven-byte string - one byte each for 'E', 'C', 'E', '2', '9', '1',
	and the end-of-string character '$'.<p>
	<a name="DatabaseFormat"><b><li>Database entry format</b></a><br>
	Each entry in the <tt>ClassSchedule</tt>, <tt>WorkSchedule</tt>, and <tt>PlaySchedule</tt> databases
	has the following format:
<pre>Day code,Start time,Duration,Description   
| 1 byte|    1 byte|  1 byte|up to 13 bytes|</pre>
	<b>Day code</b> is a byte-sized integer with the following meaning:
	<table border="1">
	<tr><td>Day code</td><td>Day of week</td></tr>
	<tr><td>0</td><td>Monday</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td>Tuesday</td></tr>
	<tr><td>2</td><td>Wednesday</td></tr>
	<tr><td>3</td><td>Thursday</td></tr>
	<tr><td>4</td><td>Friday</td></tr></table><br>
	<b>Start time</b> is a byte-sized integer from 0 to 23, with 0 being 12am (midnight) and 23 being 11pm.<p>
	<b>Duration</b> is a byte-sized integer that tells how many hours an event lasts.<p>
	An example entry is highlighted below:
<pre>ClassSchedule   db      0,9,1,"CS 321",'$',0,0,0,0,0,0
                db      0,11,1,"MUSIC 285",'$',0,0,0
                db      0,13,1,"KINES 104",'$',0,0,0
                db      1,13,2,"LEIST 100",'$',0,0,0
<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">                db      1,15,1,"ECE 311",'$',0,0,0,0,0</span>
                db      1,17,1,"MUSIC 287",'$',0,0,0</pre>
	This entry tells us that there is an event called "ECE 311" on Tuesday (Day code 1), at 3pm (hour 15),
	for 1 hour.  The zeros at the end of this entry (and most other entries) don't do anything but 
	simply pad the entry out to be 16 bytes long.<p>

	<li><a name="DaySchedule"><b>The <tt>DaySchedule</tt> array</b></a><br>
	To build our single-day schedule, we'll use an array called <tt>DaySchedule</tt>.
	This array has 15 rows, each with 16 characters (16 bytes) in each row.  Each row corresponds to
	a 1-hour timeslot in the day's schedule, with the first row (row 0) corresponding to 9am.
	Remember, all rows in this array are 16 bytes long, so the start of row 1,
	corresponding to 10am, is located 16 bytes beyond the start of row 0.  Row 2, corresponding to
	11am, is located 16 bytes beyond the start of row 1.  And so on.
	</ul>

<H2>Brief Intro to PUSH and POP</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>Pushing and poping are stack operations and will be covered later in 
  lecture. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>PUSHA will record onto the stack a copy of the data in all of the CPU's 
  registers. POPA removes the data from the stack and copies it back to the 
  registers. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Pushing and popping is, among other things, used to ensure that a 
  called function doesn't scramble registers that the calling function 
  uses. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>You can push and pop individual registers with instructions like <TT>push 
  ax</TT> and <TT>pop cx</TT>. PUSHA and POPA save <I>all</I> of the registers 
  to the stack.  Pushing and popping individual registers is the 
  preferred method of saving/restoring register data when calling a function. 
  PUSHA and POPA are used here for simplicity.

    <h2>MP1 Program Assignment</h2>
    <p>In this machine problem, the main procedure is provided for you; however, 
    you must write the code to replace the library procedures. You will replace 
    these procedures from the LIBMP1 library by commenting out the statements 
    calling the library procedure and adding your code. Each procedure that you 
    write should match the output of the library code exactly. Each of the 
    function calls and their functionality is described below in the <b>
    Procedures</b> section. The best way to get a feel for the program is to run 
    it to see how it is supposed to operate. You can also edit the test file to 
    see how various changes will affect the program execution.</p>
    <p>The program can be run by typing <tt>mp1</tt> at the command prompt. </p>
    

<H2>Development Log and Cover Memo</H2>

<P>As you work on each machine problem, you will keep a simple MP 
development log. The log will document your design decisions, development plan,
and debugging experiences, including the time you spent on different parts
of the machine problem. The log may be kept in any form. In general, whenever
you work on a machine problem, briefly record the starting time, 
significant design decisions, progress in coding and
testing, bugs you discovered, and the ending time. Do <I>not</I> record
simple syntax errors detected by NASM at assembly time; these 
are not considered to be bugs.</P>

<P>For each machine problem, beginning with MP1, you will submit a cover memo of
200 to 400 words (up to one page, single spaced). The cover memo
should answer the following questions, based on the information that you
record in your MP development log. 
<UL>
<LI>How much time did you spend on the design, coding, and testing of
each part or subroutine? </LI>
<LI>What kinds of defects (bugs) did you find during the development 
of the program? When did you discover these defects (during
code review or during testing)? How did you find them?</LI>
<LI>What you would do differently for the next MP?</LI>
</UL>
Type your cover memo into a plain text file in your MP1 directory
</P>


<h2>Hints</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The LIBMP1 file contains executable library functions for each of the 
      routines that you need to implement. This allows you to run the program 
      and understand how it works before you implement it. You can test your 
      program with any combinations of your own code and library functions. You 
      will only receive credit, however, for the routines that you implement 
      yourself.<p></li>
      <li>When debugging your code in TD, you will find it helpful to use the 
      memory window to show you the memory location of the file and strings. You 
      can also use the watch window to keep track of variables in your code.<p></li>
      <li>You may define new variables as needed.<p></li>
      <li>Be very careful if you call another procedure not to destroy registers 
      that the calling procedure uses.<p></li>
      <li><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">START EARLY!</span> This is 
      the first MP that requires you to write your own program. Composition is 
      much more difficult than comprehension.<p></li>
      <li>Be careful to preserve register values you need in all of the 
      procedures you write. &quot;dspmsg,&quot; for example, destroys the contents of 
      several registers that you might have been using for something else. You 
      can use &quot;pusha&quot; to save all your register values before making a 
      destructive call, and &quot;popa&quot; to get all your values back.<p></li>
      <li>You need to create function headers for each of the functions you 
      write.&nbsp; Function headers should include the name of the function, the 
      list of inputs to the function, the list of the outputs, and any functions 
      that the function calls.&nbsp; Function headers and comments let you keep 
      all your points!<p></li>
      <li>Monitor the <a href="http://my.ece.uiuc.edu/secure/webboard.asp">
      webboard</a> for clarifications and help.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Procedures</h2>
    <p>This assignment has seven procedures.  Three of them are given in the mp1.asm file.
       You will receive credit by replacing the other four procedures listed below with your own code.</p>
    <table BORDER="1">
      <tr VALIGN="TOP">
        <td valign="middle" width="108"><font size="+1"><b>CheckEntry</b></font></td>
        <td>
        <ul>
	  <li>Checks to see if there are enough open timeslots in <tt>DaySchedule</tt> for
              the event pointed to by <tt>si</tt>
	  <li>Inputs:<br>
		<ul><li>si = The address of the database entry we are to check</ul>
	  <li>Returns:<br>
		<ul><li><tt>[FreeSlot] = 0</tt> if the event is able to be scheduled
		    <li><tt>[FreeSlot] = -1</tt> if there was a scheduling conflict</ul>
	  <li>Notes:<ul>
	      <li>The start time and duration (in hours) for the event can be found in
              the event's database entry.  The database entry format was described
	      <a href="#DatabaseFormat">above</a>.
	      <li>This function must check all required timeslots for the duration of the event.
	      For example, if the event starts at 1pm and has a duration of 3 hours, timeslots
              1pm, 2pm, and 3pm must all be checked.
	      <li>Remember that the first timeslot in <tt>DaySchedule</tt> corresponds to 9am.
	      Also, recall that all timeslots in <tt>DaySchedule</tt>
	      are 16 bytes.  You should be able to use the
	      start time found in the database entry as an index into the <tt>DaySchedule</tt> array
	      using subtraction and shifting operations.  Review the blurb on
	      <a href="#DaySchedule"><tt>DaySchedule</tt></a> for more information.
              <li>The timeslot is "open" if the first character of the corresponding location in the
              <tt>DaySchedule</tt> array is a '$'.
	  <li>If the first character of the timeslot is <b>not</b> a '$', that means that there is an event already
	      in that timeslot.  This is a scheduling conflict.  Set <tt>[FreeSlot]</tt> to -1
	      and return immediately.
          <li>Continue checking timeslots for the number of hour-long timeslots specified by
	      the "Duration" field in the database entry.  This should be done using a loop.
	  <li>If all the required timeslots are available, set <tt>[FreeSlot]</tt> to 0 and return.</ul>

              or doing Nothing and updates the <tt>[PercentageArray]</tt> with the correct percentages.</li>
          <li>Inputs: <tt>[HoursArray]</tt> contains how many hours are spent in Class, Work, and Play,
	  and Nothing.
          "Nothing" is what's left over after those three have been added (i.e. 24 - (Class+Work+Play) ).
	  You do not need to worry about calculating this, however.  It will be set up in the
	  <tt>HoursArray</tt> for you already.
          <li>Output: All four bytes in <tt>[PercentageArray]</tt> contain the percentage of the day
          spent at Class, Work, Play, and doing Nothing.
          <li>Notes:
		<ul><li>To find the percentage, the formula is 100*num/24.  Make sure you multiply
		by 100 first.
		<li>This function must be written using a loop to go through all 4 categories.
		Either the "register relative" or "base plus index" addressing modes are useful
		in this function. Review your lecture notes or look at the
		<a href="http://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece291/lecture/potts/index.html">online lecture notes</a>
		for more information on memory addressing.
		<li>Using <tt>mul</tt> and <tt>div</tt> is tricky, and won't be covered until a week
                before this MP is due.
		If you need help with these instructions, ask a TA or consult your lab manual.</ul>

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ul>
<li>You will begin this MP with the following files:
    <ul>
    <li><tt>MP1.ASM</tt>: Program Framework
    <li><tt>Makefile</tt>: Specifies how and when programs are assembled
        and linked.
    <li><tt>LIBMP1.LIB</tt>: Library functions for MP1
    <li><tt>LIB291.LIB</tt>: General-purpose library functions
    </ul>
<li>You may copy these files from the network drive to your home directory
    with the following command: <br>
    <tt>xcopy /s V:\ece291\mp1 W:\mp1</tt><br>
    or download the files from this server as <a href="mp1.zip">mp1.zip</a> 
<li>Add your code to <tt>MP1.ASM</tt>.
<li>Assemble and link your program by typing<br>
      <tt>make</tt><Br>
    This command reads <i>Makefile</i> then invokes NASM and TLINK to build 
    an executable program.  
<li>Use Turbo Debugger (TD) to find and correct program errors. 
<li>Verify your program operation.
</ul>

    <h2>Final Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Demonstrate your MP1.EXE to a TA or to the instructor.&nbsp; The TA or 
      instructor will verify that your program produces the correct output. </li>
      <li>Be prepared to answer questions about any aspect of the operation of 
      your program. The TAs will not accept an MP if you cannot fully explain 
      the operation of your code and details of your implementation. Delayed MPs 
      will be subject to late penalties as described in the course syllabus 
      (10pts/day).</li>
      <li>The TA will handin your MP online.</li>
    </ol>
