<h1>Handling User Input</h1>
<p>You'll be able to control the pieces with both the keyboard and the mouse.</p>
<h2>Keyboard</h2>
<p>After MP3, keyboard ISRs should be no problem for you now.&nbsp; In the
keyboard ISR, you will need to update the GameFlags variable when the user wants
to move or rotate the current piece, or when the user wants to end the game. </p>
<h2><a name="mouse">Mouse</a></h2>
<p>Like the keyboard, you need procedures for installation, removal, and
handling the mouse data.
<p><strong>But!</strong></p>
<p>The mouse handler isn't truly a handler at all. It's a callback. A callback
is the best of both worlds: it gets called like a normal procedure, getting all
data in standard places instead of having to perform odd I/O to get it; yet it
is also called in interrupt fashion - only, and immediately, when data is
available.</p>
<p>Or to look at it slightly less positive way, it's still called from an
interrupt, so you have to be careful about what you call - particularly no DOS
interrupts.</p>
<p>Luckily for you, the library does have a function available that gets a
real-mode callback address for your protected mode callback: Get_RMCB. However,
you will still need to tell the mouse driver to call the callback, and where the
callback is.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use Get_RMCB to get a real-mode callback address for MouseCallback. Save
    the segment and offset in MouseSeg and MouseOff
  <li>Call the Mouse interrupt (33h), function 0Ch to have the mouse driver call
    your callback on left and right mouse button press and mouse movement</li>
</ul>
<p>Removing the mouse callback is a matter of reversing your steps.
<ul>
  <li>Again use the mouse interrupt, this time to tell the mouse not to call
    your callback - use segment:offset of 0000:0000 for &quot;no callback&quot;
  <li>Then, use Free_RMCB to release the real-mode callback</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you've got the callback installing and removing, what does your
actual callback have to do?&nbsp; The same thing as the keyboard handler
does.&nbsp; When the user wants to move or rotate the piece by using the mouse,
just update the GameFlags variable accordingly. </p>
