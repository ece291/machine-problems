<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>I don't know about you, but I like having properly formatted assembly
programs, because they're so easy to read and debug. But I hate typing
in all the tabs and spaces to make my code look pretty. (Actually, my development
environment does it for me!) Since many of you will no doubt be using MS-Notepad
and EDIT to create your programs, I thought it might be helpful to have
a program which can create a new source file, replete with proper tabs
and spacings. </P>

<H2>Problem Description</H2>

<P>This program will run through a text file, screening out excess and
insufficient whitespace (spaces, tabs, etc.) The new text is reformatted
so that all text is lowercase, all assembly statements are indented equally.
Comments are tabbed out to an appropriate distance, though any new lines
beginning with a ';' should be left justified.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+0>The general algorithm for this MP&nbsp;is as follows:</FONT></P>

<UL>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>1. Open a file to read from ('input file') using OPENFILE<BR>
2. Open a file to write to ('output file') using CREATEFILE<BR>
3. Until end of file/file error:</FONT></P>

<UL>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>3a. Read a character from the input file<BR>
3b. If character is a newline, write a newline, then check read the next
character:</FONT></P>

<UL>
<P><FONT SIZE=+0>3b1. If it's a semicolon, write a semicolon, goto 3a<BR>
3b2. If it's not, write INDENT1 spaces, goto 3b to check what the character
is</FONT></P>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>3c. If the character is a space or a tab, write a space
for the first one (ignore successive ones), goto 3a<BR>
3d. If the character is a semicolon, write INDENT2 tabs, followed by a
semicolon, goto 3a<BR>
3e. Last case: write the lowercase version of the character, goto 3a</FONT></P>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>4. Close both files using CLOSEFILES.<BR>
5. Print the total words in the input file.<BR>
6. Calculate and print the average word length, to the nearest 1/100 of
a letter.<BR>
7. Call DOSXIT to end the program.</FONT></P>
</UL>

<P>Notes:</P>

<UL>
<P>1. You should use a register or a memory variable to keep track of whether
a whitespace character is the first one.<BR>
2. A newline in a text file is actually TWO characters, a carriage return
(0Dh) followed by a linefeed (0A). Once you read a carrage return, you
can assume the next character is automatically a linefeed. Neither character
should normally appear in a text file by itself.</P>
</UL>

<P>Your program is required to: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Output data in the same format as the <I>sample output</I> given later
in this assignment. </LI>

<LI>Reformat several different test cases the TAs might present. </LI>

<LI>Count and display the number of words in the file </LI>

<LI>Count and display the average word length </LI>

<LI>Run efficiently. Points will be deducted for inefficient algorithms
and excessive coding. </LI>

<H2>Procedure</H2>

<UL>
<LI>You will begin this MP with the following files: </LI>

<UL>
<LI><TT>MP1.ASM</TT>: Program Framework </LI>

<LI><TT>TEST1.ASM</TT>: Test assembly file </LI>

<LI><TT>Makefile</TT>: Specifies how and when programs are assembled and
linked. </LI>

<LI><TT>MP1.LIB</TT>: Library functions for MP1 </LI>
</UL>

<LI>You may copy these files from the network drive to your home directory
with the following command: <BR>
<TT>xcopy /s G:\ece291\mp1 F:\mp1<BR>
</TT>or download the files from this server as <A HREF="http://www.ece.uiuc.edu/~ece291/mp/mp1/mp1.zip">mp1.zip</A>
</LI>

<LI>Add your code to <TT>MP1.ASM</TT>. </LI>

<LI>Assemble and link your program by typing<BR>
<TT>nmake<BR>
</TT>This command reads <I>Makefile</I> then invokes MASM and LINK to build
an executable program. </LI>

<LI>Use DEBUG or CodeView (CV) to find and correct program errors. </LI>

<LI>Verify your program operation by testing with different input files.
</LI>

<LI><B><I><U><BLINK><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Do NOT try to use your program
on its own source!!! </FONT></BLINK></U></I></B></LI>
</UL>

<H2>Free Subroutines</H2>

<UL>
<P>The following routines are included in MP1.LIB for your use. They may
be included in your program without penalty, in fact, you can't write the
MP without them!:</P>

<H2>Final Steps</H2>

<OL>
<LI>Test you code with multiple test cases, which will be provided.</LI>

<LI>Demonstrate MP1.EXE to a TA or to the instructor. You will be asked
to recompile and demonstrate MP1. Successful completion of your program
with different inputs will ensure that you followed directions and that
your program has no hard-coded operations. </LI>

<LI>Be sure that your name and date appears in the first line of MP1.ASM.
</LI>

<LI>Copy your programs to a floppy using the following command: <BR>
<TT>xcopy /s F:\mp1 a:\mp1</TT> </LI>

<LI>Print MP1.ASM and the <A HREF="http://www.ece.uiuc.edu/~ece291/mp/mp1/mp1r.html">grade
sheet</A>. </LI>

<LI>Take your printout and disk with MP1 to the same TA which approved
your demonstration. </LI>
