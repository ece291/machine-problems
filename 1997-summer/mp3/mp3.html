<H2>Introduction</H2>

<UL>
<P>One of the most impressive and complex programs that can be created
for DOS is a Terminate and Stay Resident pop-up utility. DOS has no documented
functions to support resident utilities, but over the last decade, many
undocumented featres have been found to allow us to implement them. Microsoft
still denies that some of the functions described even exist. For this
MP, we'll use some of those features to write a simple screen saver. The
screen saver will pop up whenever we have not pressed a key for a certain
length of time.</P>
</UL>

<H2>Problem Description</H2>

<UL>
<P>The TSR is built in several stages. The first three routines you will
write all dra text-mode graphics. TextStr can write a string in any attribute
at any location on the screen. TextBox can draw a box at a given location
in a given size and attribute. ClrScr clears the screen to any attribute.
Once these are successfully implemented, you can move on to the next stage,
implementeing Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs)&nbsp;for Interrupts 09h,
1Ch, and 64h. When those work, the last stage should be telling the program
to make itself resident, and to activate itself under certain conditons.</P>

<P>The program installs itself once, and returns you to a DOS prompt. Successive
attempts to install the TSR will print an error message. When the user
has not hit a key for several minutes, or if the user hits the F10 key,
the screen saver will &quot;pop-up&quot;and run. It will continue to run
until the user hits a key. If the user hits the Escape Key while the screeen
saver is running, it will unload itself and print a checklist of the rouitnes
and ISRs used.</P>
</UL>

<H2>Sample Output</H2>

<UL>
<LI>Before you begin, be sure that you fully understand the assignment.
Perhaps the best way to understand how the program works is to watch it
operate. Visit the lab or download the code <A HREF="mp3.zip">mp3.zip</A>
and run the library-based MP3SOL.EXE. </LI>

<H2>Implementation</H2>

<P>The structure for this machine problem has already been defined to consist
of the subroutines listed below. Once you understand the structure of the
program, begin by coding the MAIN routine. There are library routines for
all functions. You are encouraged to use these functions while you are
debugging your code. </P>

<P>Once you have coded your own MAIN routine, you may write the other routines
in any order that you wish. For all procedures, input and output values
are passed to and from the procedures via registers. If a register is not
specified as an output, its value should not be altered by the routine.
</P>

<P>When you are not implementing TSR code, you chould end you main with
DOSXIT. However, to make a program resident, you should instead execute
the following code:</P>

<UL>
<TABLE BORDER=1 >
<TR>
<TD>
<PRE>   mov ax,3100h    ; DOS Function 31h -TSR, return value in AL=0
   mov dx,1500     ; DX= number of paragraphs (16 bytes)
   int 21h         ; Terminates program, stays resident</PRE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</UL>

<P>This code will end the program, but will keep the contents in memory.
NOTE: Currently, this TSR does not free the memory it allocates. If multiple
copies are installed, then uninstalled, each will steal 24K from the the
available free memory. Eventually, DOS will run out of memory. In Comupter
Programming terms, this is known as a &quot;memory leak&quot;. However,
since we really will only run one copy once ever,<BR>
this is acceptable. The TSR also has problems interrupting MS-EDIT, which
tampers with the same ISRs that our utility modifies. If the TSR&nbsp;pops
up while you are in MS-EDIT, you will probably crash your computer.</P>

<P>Timer decrements the time left until the TSR is activated. When the
countdown reaches zero, or F10 has been pressed, Timer will signal the
8259PIC with an end of interrupt, enable interrupts,and call the Kernel.
Timer should use semaphore variables to communicate with KeyHandler, and
to prevent multiple pop-ups.<BR>
Timer should call the old 1Ch ISR before doing anything else, and should
end with an IRET instruction. All registers <B>MUST</B> be preserved.</P>

</U>None</P>

<P>Keyhandler should reset the countdown to TSR activation, and should
monitor the keyboard input via BIOS 16h calls, and should intercept the
F10 key. KeyHandler should use a semaphore variable to communicate to Timer
that the F10 key has been pressed. KeyHandler should call the old 09h ISR
before doing anything else, and should end with an IRET instruction. All
registers <B>MUST</B> be preserved.</P>

<P>Kernel saves the contents of video memory, clears the screen using ClrScr,
draws a box on the screen using TextBox, prints your name using TextStr,
and scrolls a line of text (your choice) across the screen. When a key
is pressed, Kernel will exit. The key hit was the escape key, Kernel will
first restore all the interrupt vectors to their normal values, and call
MP3check. (This will de-instalzl the TSR.)</P>

<P>MP3Setup is part of a few procedures designed to make buildingyour TSR
easier. It will save vital information<BR>
about the state of the computer. The conterpart procedure is MP3Check.
If you call MP3Setup without calling MP3Check at the end, your program

</U>None 
<P>The output of MP3Check is visible above. If you do not restore an interrupt
vector properly, MP3Check will inform you, after which your program will
probably crash. MP3Check also acts like previous MPXITs, printing the procedures
used from the library. After displaying the information, MP3Check will
wait for the user to press a key before exiting. If you do not call MP3Setup
in your program before calling MP3check, your program <B>WILL CRASH</B>.</P>

<H2>Hints:</H2>

<OL>
<LI>START&nbsp;THIS&nbsp;MP&nbsp;EARLY.</LI>

<LI>You can expect the last stages of the development to be more difficult
to debug, because they are very close to the hardware of the machine. Because
of this, you cannot run CodeView to check your TSR or ISR routines. Also,
any bugs in the routines can lock your system or crash your DOS&nbsp;Window.
Be sure to visibly inspect all your code for bugs before running it!</LI>

<LI>ISRs must never modify any registers. Push and Pop all registers used
in the ISR</LI>

<LI>BALANCE the STACK, BALANCE the STACK, BALANCE the STACK.</LI>

<LI>Write all code as non-TSR first, to catch errors early.</LI>

<LI>Write and test each procedure separately, using library routines (known
working code!)</LI>

<LI>When you get one routine working correctly, MAKE&nbsp;A&nbsp;BACKUP.</LI>
