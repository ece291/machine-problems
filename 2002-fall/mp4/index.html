<BLOCKQUOTE>
Imagine if all cars had nonstandard engines that were built by hand.
And imagine that each make of car needed its own special fuel, which
had to be hand blended in a laboratory.... Computer users have come
to accept such a bizarre situation as normal.  Most software is still
constructed piece by piece by highly trained craftsmen--a costly and
inefficient practice reminiscent of the blacksmiths and wood-carvers
of past centuries."  --Robert Haavind, <i>Technology Review</i>, Feb/Mar 1992
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>You will write a program MP4 that implements the popular worm video game.
This program is similar to the Nybbles machine problem assigned in Spring 2002,
but the internal structure is completely different.</p>

<P>Files for MP4 are on the <tt>V:</tt> drive in the directory <tt>V:\ece291\mp4</tt>.
In this directory are the program framework <tt>mp4.asm</tt> and a 
running version of the program <tt>mp4lab.exe</tt>. Lab versions of subroutines
are in <tt>libmp4.lib</tt>, which contains all subroutines of LIB291 plus 
libInit, libKbdInt, libTask1, libTask2, libCheckLegal, libGenFood, libEnq, 
and libDeq. You will use mp4xit instead of dosxit.
You should start by copying these files to your home directory with the following command: <BR>
<TT>xcopy /s V:\ece291\mp4 W:\mp4</TT><BR>
You may download the files from the server as 
<A href="http://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece291/mp/mp4/mp4.zip">mp4.zip</A>  </p>

<p> Reading: Lab Notes, Sections 10.1 (Keyboard), 11.1 (Text Mode) <br>
Reference: Lab Notes, Section 11.3 (Interrupt 10h)</p>

<H2>Program Specification</H2>

<p>
A multi-segment worm travels across the 80x25 display screen.
The user presses the arrow keys to change the direction of the worm head
right, up, left, and down.
When the worm head reaches a food pellet, the worm grows by 4 body segments.
The game ends when the worm head hits the boundary of the display or one
of its current body segments. Pressing the ESC key exits the program.
</p> 

<h2>Program Organization</h2>

<P>In this machine problem, the main procedure is provided for you; 
however, you must write the code to replace the library subroutines 
libInit, libKbdInt, libTask1, libTask2, libCheckLegal, libGenFood, libEnq, and
libDeq. You will replace these subroutines from the libmp4 library by deleting the 
statements that call the libmp4 subroutine and by adding your own code. 
Each subroutine that you write should match the output of the library 
subroutine exactly.</P>

<p>
The program uses the following global variables:
<pre>
SavKOff RESW    1                       ; Keyboard interrupt vector
SavKSeg RESW    1
SavTOff RESW    1                       ; User timer interrupt vector
SavTSeg RESW    1
Ticks   DW      0                       ; Number of timer ticks
Dir     DW      0                       ; 0=right, 1=up, 2=left, 3=down
State   DB      0                       ; Positive if growing, 0 if normal,
                                        ;   -1 if stopped
Food    DW      0FFFFh                  ; Location of food pellet
</pre>
<p>
<tt>SavKOff</tt> and <tt>SavKSeg</tt> are the offset and segment
words in the original keyboard interrupt vector (type 9). 
Similarly <tt>SavTOff</tt>
and <tt>SavTSeg</tt> are the offset and segment words in the original user
timer interrupt vector (type 1Ch).<br>
<tt>Dir</tt> specifies the current direction of movement of the worm head: 0 
for moving right, 1 for up, 2 for left, 3 for down.
<br>
<tt>State</tt> is -1 if the worm has stopped, 0 if it is moving normally, and
a positive value if it is growing. For a growing worm, <tt>State</tt> specifies
the number of body segments to be added.
<br>
<tt>Food</tt> specifies the location of the food pellet: row in high byte, 
column in low byte.
</p>

<p>
The program uses two circular queues: a Keyboard Queue to store keyboard scan
codes and a Worm Queue to store the locations of body segments of the worm. The 
implementation of these queues is different from the implementations in class
and in Spring 2002.
<pre>
QBeg    EQU     0                       ; Beginning offset of queue area
QCap    EQU     2                       ; Capacity of of queue
QFront  EQU     4                       ; Index of front item
QRear   EQU     6                       ; Index of rear item
QCount  EQU     8                       ; How many items currently in queue
QData   EQU     10                      ; Byte to input or output

KQList  RESB    0                       ; Parameter list for Keyboard Queue
KQBeg   DW      KQArea                  ; Offset of Keyboard Queue area
KQCap   DW      10
KQFront DW      0
KQRear  DW      -1
KQCount DW      0
KQData  RESB    1
KQArea  RESB    10

WQList  RESB    0                       ; Parameter list for Worm Queue
WQBeg   DW      WQArea                  ; Offset of Worm Queue area
WQCap   DW      80*25*2
WQFront DW      0                       ; Index of tail of worm
WQRear  DW      -1                      ; Index of head of worm
WQCount DW      0
WQData  RESB    1
WQArea  RESB    80*25*2
</pre>
Each queue is specified by a parameter list.  The first word of the list
specifies the offset of the first byte of the queue area, where data are stored.
The second word is the capacity of the queue.
The third word of the parameter list is the <i>index</i> of the byte at the front 
of the queue, and the fourth word is the <i>index</i> of the byte at the rear
of the queue.  These indices run from 0 to the capacity minus 1.  The byte at
the front of the queue is the first to be dequeued.  The byte at the rear of the
queue was the last to be enqueued.  The fifth word of the parameter list is
a count of the number of items currently stored in the queue.  Enq uses the
Data byte on the parameter list for the item to be enqueued, and Deq delivers
the dequeued item into this byte.
</p>
On the Worm Queue, information about the location of each body segment occupies
two bytes: the location column and row enqueued in the order
column first, then row second.
<p>
</p>

<p>The mp4.asm program framework has the User timer interrupt service routine
TimInt and a random number generator subroutine Rand.
</p>

<P>You will replace each of the subroutines listed below with your own code.
Document each subroutine with a header.

Init saves the old User timer and Keyboard interrupt vectors and changes

<tt>INT 10h</tt> to select 80x25 text video mode and to clear the display area. 
Init displays the initial
worm with four body segments, including the head, at the middle of the screen

the scan code for the ESC key, then Task1 restores the old interrupt
vectors and exits to DOS. If the byte is the scan code for an arrow
key, then Task1 changes Dir appropriately. Otherwise, no action is taken.

Task2 exits if either fewer than 3 ticks have elapsed or the 
State is -1. Otherwise, Task2 subtracts 3 from Ticks. If State
is 0, then Task2 dequeues the column and row of the worm's tail from
the Worm Queue and erases the display of the tail.  If State is
greater than 0, then Task2 omits this step but decrements State
by 1. Next, Task2 updates the position of the head in the
direction specified by Dir. Task2 calls CheckLegal to determine
whether the new head position would be outside the display 
screen or a location of part of the body of the worm. If it is,
then Task2 changes State to -1 to stop the worm and changes
the display of the head. Otherwise, if the new position is legal,
then Task2 replaces the current head by a regular body character,
displays the head in the new position, and enqueues the column and
row of the new head position onto the Worm Queue. If the new
head position is the same as the location of a food pellet, then
Task2 calls GenFood to generate a new food pellet and adds 4
to State.

<h2>Optional Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>You may choose your own colors and characters for the worm head, worm body,
and food pellet.</li>
<li>You may draw a border at the boundary of the display. By drawing a boundary,
you would reduce the number of rows and columns available for the worm and
the food pellets.</li>
<li>You may keep count of the number of food pellets the worm has eaten and
print the score when the game ends.</li>
<li>You may increase the speed of the worm as the game progresses.
</ul>

<H2>Friendly Advice</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The libmp4.lib file contains executable library subroutines for each of 
the routines that you need to implement. The library subroutines allow
you to run the program and understand how it works before you implement it. 
You can test your program with any combinations of your own code and library 
subroutines. You will receive credit only for the subroutines that 
you implement yourself. </li>
<LI>You may define new memory variables as needed. Variables associated with a 
subroutine should be declared between the header comments and name label of the
subroutine.</li>
<li>You may design and implement additional subroutines.</li>
<li>Each subroutine should save and restore any registers that it uses,
except for registers that deliver subroutine outputs.  The caller 
may use registers without outputs and expect them to remain unchanged. </li>
<li>To hide the cursor, Init can use INT 10h to move the cursor
to a location not on the display, such as row 25.</li>
<li>KbdInt should save and restore all registers that it uses. </li>
<li>The part of Task1 that dequeues a byte from the Keyboard Queue is a critical
section. Protect it with CLI/STI. </li>
<li>Access entries in the Worm Queue carefully. For each body segment
there is a pair of bytes; the column location is in the lower address, the row
in the higher address of the pair.
<LI>Monitor the newsgroups <A href="news:uiuc.class.ece291">uiuc.class.ece291</A> 
and for <A href="news:uiuc.class.ece291.announce">uiuc.class.ece291.announce</A>
clarifications and help.</li>
<LI>START EARLY!</LI>
</UL>

<h2>Demonstration, Documentation, and Grading</h2>
<p>Demonstrate your program to an ECE 291 staff member. He will ask you several
questions about the operation of your program.</p>
<p>As before, keep an MP development log and write a cover memo, which should
be submitted with the program after the demonstration.
The cover memo should address the following questions:
<UL>
<LI>How much time did you spend on each subroutine, from
planning and design through final debugging? </LI>
<LI>What kinds of defects (bugs) did you find during the development 
of the program? When did you discover these defects (during
code review or during testing)? How did you find them?</LI>
<LI>What did you learn about design, coding, testing, and debugging
in this MP?</LI>
<LI>What went well in your work on this MP?  What did not?</LI>
<LI>What you would do differently for the next MP?</LI>
<LI>If you did the optional debugging exercises, then 
please comment on the usefulness of those exercises.
</UL>
<p>Your program will be graded according to the clarity of your design
and the quality of your documentation.</p>
