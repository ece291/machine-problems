Now all of the communications plugs the physical link, the
RS232 connector, is the simplest. I think it was discovered in 
the ruins at Pompeii -- the Romans probably used it to interface
with their data runners. It specifies voltages (plus and minus)
which are prehistoric. It even predates TTL. But it is all there
is. When forced back to bare copper and elemental, ASCII 
transmission, RS232 is always there, and we should be thankful,
because in the intricacies of the higher layers of communications
protocol lies a tower of Babel -- virtual plugs misted in 
indescribable complexity.

<P>Working in teams, you will write a single program MP5 that implements a 
version of the classic Pong video game
over the serial port. When MP5 is run on two computers whose serial ports
are connected, the user at one computer controls the left paddle, and the
user at the other computer controls the right paddle. The circular ball bounces off
the paddles and off the top and bottom boundaries of the screen. When the
ball reaches the left or right boundaries without bouncing off a paddle,
the program stops. (Alternatively, the program can keep score.)</p>

<P>Files for MP5 are on the <tt>V:</tt> drive in the directory <tt>V:\ece291\mp5</tt>.
In this directory are the program framework <tt>mp5.asm</tt> and a 
running version of the program <tt>mp5lab.exe</tt>. Lab versions of subroutines
are in <tt>libmp5.lib</tt>, which contains all subroutines of LIB291 plus 
libInit, libReceiveSrv, libTransmitSrv, libTask1, libTask2, libTask3,
libMoveBall, libMovePaddle, and libCircle. You will use mp5xit instead of dosxit.
You should start by copying these files to your home directory with the following command: <BR>
<TT>xcopy /s V:\ece291\mp5 W:\mp5</TT><BR>
You may download the files from the server as 
<A href="http://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece291/mp/mp5/mp5.zip">mp5.zip</A>  </p>

<p> Reading: Lab Notes, Chapter 12</p>

<H2>Program Specification</H2>

<p>
The program has three modes of operation.
<ol start="0">
<li> Mode 0: Self-testing. In this mode, the up-arrow and down-arrow keys 
control both the left and the right paddles. This mode does not use the
serial port. It is particularly useful for testing the program on a 
single computer.
</li>
<li> Mode 1: Primary. In this mode, the up-arrow and down-arrow keys 
control only the left paddle. With each clock tick, the ball moves, and the
left paddle may move.
The program sends information about movement of the ball and the left paddle
over the serial port and receives information about the movement of the right
paddle from the serial port. 
</li>
<li> Mode 2: Secondary. In this mode, the up-arrow and down-arrow keys
control only the right paddle. The program receives information about
movement of the ball and the left paddle over the serial port and changes
the display to reflect these movements. The program sends information 
about movement of the right paddle over the serial port.
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The program begins by prompting the user for the mode (0, 1, or 2) and for
the ball radius (2, ..., 9 pixels). Then the the program displays the playing
field. At this point, pressing the arrow keys moves the paddles. As long as
the up-arrow key is depressed, the paddle moves up; as long as the down-arrow key
is depressed, the paddle moves down. When the key is released, the paddle stops
moving. Pressing the space bar allows the ball to start moving.
Whenever the space bar is depressed, the program toggles between moving and
stopping the ball.
</p>
<p>
When the ball bounces off the top or bottom boundary of the screen, its
speed remains about the same, but its vertical velocity changes direction. When
the ball bounces off the top half of the left paddle, the ball begins moving
upward to the right at a random slope. When the ball bounces
off the bottom half of the left paddle, the ball begins moving downward to the
right at a random slope. Similarly, when the ball bounces off the 
right paddle, it begins moving leftward at a random slope, upward or downward
depending on whether the ball hit the top or bottom half of the right paddle.
</p>
<p>
At any time, pressing the ESC key exits the program.
</p> 

<h2>Program Organization</h2>

<P>In this machine problem, the main procedure is provided for you.
You must write the code to replace the library subroutines 
libInit, libReceiveSrv, libTransmitSrv, libTask1, libTask2, libTask3,
libMoveBall, libMovePaddle, and libCircle.
You will replace these subroutines from the libmp5 library by deleting the 
statements that call the libmp5 subroutine and by adding your own code. 
Each subroutine that you write should match the output of the library 
subroutine exactly.</P>
<p>
You may use parts of your team members' subroutines for MP4, such as
TimerInt, KbdInt, Enq, and Deq.
</p>
<p>
The program uses the following global variables:
<pre>SavKOff RESW    1               ; Keyboard interrupt vector
SavKSeg RESW    1
SavTOff RESW    1               ; Timer interrupt vector
SavTSeg RESW    1
SavCOff RESW    1               ; Serial communication port vector
SavCSeg RESW    1
Ticks   DW      0               ; Number of timer ticks
State   DB      0               ; 0 = ball stopped, 1 = ball moving
Radius  DW      8               ; Radius of ball
Mode    DB      0               ; 0 = self-testing, 1 = primary, 2 = secondary
PDir    DB      0               ; Paddle direction -1 = up, 0 = stopped, 1 = down
VVeloc  DW      0               ; Vertical velocity of ball (negative to move up)
HVeloc  DW      -4              ; Horizontal velocity of ball (negative to move left)
BCol    DW      160             ; Current position of center of ball: column
BRow    DW      100             ; Current position of center of ball: row
LPaddle DW      90              ; Top row of left paddle
RPaddle DW      90              ; Top row of right paddle
</pre>
There are also parameter lists for the Keyboard Queue (<tt>KQList</tt>),
Transmit Queue (<tt>TQList</tt>), and Receive Queue (<tt>RQList</tt>).
</p>
<p>You may use without penalty the following subroutines, which are provided
in the <tt>mp5.asm</tt> program framework.
<ul>
<li>Rand -- Generate a random number in the range 0, ..., (CX)-1</li>
<li>EnableTI -- Enable ready-to-transmit interrupts from the 8250 ACE</li>
<li>DisableTI -- Disable ready-to-transmit interrupts from the 8250 ACE</li>
<li>SerialInit -- Initialize the 8250 ACE with the baud rate and frame format</li>
<li>SerialReset -- Reset the 8250 ACE, disabling its interrupts</li>
<li>ComInt -- Part of interrupt service routine for serial communication port</li>
</ul>
</p>
<P>Your team will replace each of the subroutines listed below with your own code.
Document each subroutine with a header.

<tt>INT 10h</tt> to select 320x200 graphics mode and displays the
paddles and ball at their initial positions. Each paddle is 20 pixels
high, 10 pixels wide, and positioned 10 pixels from the left or right
boundary of the screen.

Task1 first checks that the Keyboard Queue is nonempty.  If so, then 
Task1 dequeues the byte at the front of the Keyboard Queue. If it is 
the scan code for the ESC key, then Task1 restores the old interrupt
vectors, calls SerialReset, and exits to DOS by calling mp5xit. 
If the byte is the scan code for an arrow
key (pressed or released), then Task1 changes PDir appropriately. 
If the byte is the scan code for the space bar, then Task1 toggles
State between 0 and 1 in Modes 0 and 1.

Task2 exits if no ticks have elapsed. Otherwise, Task2 sets Ticks to 0.
If State is not 0, then in Modes 0 and 1, Task2 calls MoveBall to move the ball
and (in Mode 1) enqueues the sync byte followed by the new values of HVeloc and VVeloc onto
the Transmit Queue.
If State is 0, then in Mode 1, Task2 enqueues the sync byte followed by two bytes of 0 for 
velocities. Next, Task2 calls MovePaddle to move the left paddle (in Modes 0 and 1)
and to move the right paddle (in Modes 0 and 2). Finally, Task2 enqueues
PDir onto the Transmit Queue and calls EnableTI to enable the serial port
to begin transmitting. (Why should Task2 call EnableTI?)
Thus, in Mode 1, Task2 enqueues four bytes
onto the queue, and in Mode 2, Task2 enqueues one byte onto the queue.

The action of Task3 depends on the Mode. In Mode 0, Task3 does nothing.
In Mode 1, if there is at least one byte on the Receive Queue, then
Task3 dequeues exactly one byte and calls MovePaddle to move the 
right paddle in the direction specified by this byte.
In Mode 2, if there are at least four bytes on the Receive Queue,
then Task3 verifies the first byte is the sync byte, or dequeues as long
as there are at least four bytes and the first is not the sync byte.  
Then Task3 dequeues the sync byte, and dequeues exactly three more bytes.
It uses the first byte to update HVeloc, the second byte to update VVeloc,
and the third byte to determine the direction to move the left paddle. It
calls MoveBall with these new values of HVeloc and VVeloc, and it calls MovePaddle.

MoveBall determines whether moving the ball from its current location
in the distance and directions specified by VVeloc and HVeloc would
make it exit the screen or collide with a paddle. If so, then MoveBall
changes VVeloc and HVeloc appropriately to make it bounce. If the ball
would bounce of the top half of a paddle, then MoveBall calls Rand
to obtain a random slope (+/- 1, 2, or 3) for the new value of VVeloc;
negative values are used to move up, positive values to move down. 
The magnitude of the new value of HVeloc should be 5 minus the magnitude of 
the new value of VVeloc, so that the apparent speed of the ball is approximately
the same in every direction. If the ball would move off the screen on
the left or right, then MoveBall changes State to 0.</li>
<li>To check a possible collision with the right paddle, simply check whether after
a move, the rightmost point of the circle, whose row would
be BRow+VVeloc and whose column would be BCol+HVeloc+Radius 
intersects the right paddle. The collision criterion for the left paddle is similar.

<h2>Optional Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>You may choose your own colors for the ball and paddles.</li>
<li>You may fill in the ball.</li>
<li>You may use Bresenham's line algorithm to determine the movement
of the ball along a line.</li>
<li>You may use a more accurate algorithm for checking a possible
collision with a paddle.</li>
<li>You may keep and display the score.</li>
<li>You may change the serial protocol to use absolute instead of relative 
positions.</li>
</ul>

      <p>Thoroughly document any optional features you choose to implement.</p>

<h2>Working in Teams</h2>
<ul>
<li>Find an equitable division of subroutines among team members.
For each subroutine one student could be the primary developer and 
another student could be the primary tester.
All students should inspect code written by other team members</li>
<li>For each team meeting, one student should serve as the manager, and 
another as the recorder; these roles should rotate so that every student has a
chance to fill each role. 
<ul>
<li>The manager is responsible for finding a time and place
for the meeting. Substantial time will be allocated in during at least one lecture
period each week for team meetings. Grainger Library has rooms specifically 
designated for group meetings. 
At the meeting, the manager should encourage everyone to 
participate, ensure that all alternatives are adequately considered,
and keep discussions on task and on time.</li>
<li>The recorder is responsible for 
taking notes, summarizing the decisions in an e-mail to all team members, and
(for the Final Project) drafting the short document due that week.</li></ul>
<li>Team members should strive to be professional and civil to each other.
Disagreements should be based on facts and technical arguments, not on personal
prejudices.</li>
<li>At the first meeting, teams should establish ground rules to encourage
active listening. For example:
<ul>  
<li>No student may be interrupted while speaking.</li>
<li>Each student must start with a brief summary of what the last
student has said.</li>
<li>All criticism must be directed at ideas, not at individuals, and
must be accompanied by constructive alternatives.</li>
</ul>
At this first meeting, teams should agree on the meanings of the four criteria
for peer evaluation: Quality of contributions, Quantity of contributions,
Timeliness, Cooperation. Teams should discuss the standards and expectations
for ratings of Excellent, Good, Fair, and Poor on each of these criteria.
</li>
</ul>

<H2>Friendly Advice</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The libmp5.lib file contains executable library subroutines for each of 
the routines that you need to implement. The library subroutines allow
you to run the program and understand how it works before you implement it. 
You can test your program with any combinations of your own code and library 
subroutines. You will receive credit only for the subroutines that 
you implement yourselves. </li>
<LI>Make sure to both the mode 1 and mode 2 client have started before pressing 
any movement keys. (Why must you do this?)</li>
<LI>You may define new memory variables as needed. You may design and implement 
additional subroutines. For example, MovePaddle and Init could both call a 
subroutine that draws a segment of a paddle.</li>
<li>Each subroutine should save and restore any registers that it uses,
except for registers that deliver subroutine outputs.  The caller 
may use registers without outputs and expect them to remain unchanged. </li>
<li>Before subroutine Circle is ready, you may write a simple routine that draws a
square of the same size (length of square side equals 2 x Radius + 1) 
to develop other subroutines that call Circle.
</li>
<li>To simulate the serial port on one computer, during development of MP5,
you may write a subroutine Port
that dequeues a byte from the Transmit Queue (provided that this queue is nonempty)
and enqueues this byte onto the Receive Queue.
<tt>libmp5.lib</tt> has a version of this subroutine, and you
should remove the call to this subroutine when 
you test your program to use the actual
serial port.
</li>
<li>Although HVeloc and VVeloc are word-sized variables (for ease of arithmetic
calculations in MoveBall), the values that you transmit are byte-sized. Note that
the low-order byte is sufficient to hold a signed value in the range -5 to +5.
</li>
<li>To erase the ball or a segment of a paddle, write over it with the color BLACK.</li>
<li>After MP5 terminates, if the DOS window fills the whole screen, use Alt-Enter
to return to a normal size window.
</li>
<LI>Monitor the newsgroups <A href="news:uiuc.class.ece291">uiuc.class.ece291</A> 
and  <A href="news:uiuc.class.ece291.announce">uiuc.class.ece291.announce</A>
for clarifications and help.</li>
<LI>START EARLY!</LI>
</UL>

<h2>Demonstration, Documentation, and Grading</h2>
<p>Demonstrate your program to an ECE 291 staff member. He may use mp5lab.exe
on one of the two connected computers.</p>
<p>Although each team will develop one program, each submission will be
individual, as in previous MPs. You will also submit confidential peer evaluations.</p>
<p>As before, keep an MP development log and write an individual cover memo,
which you should submit with the program after the demonstration.
The cover memo should address the following questions:
<UL>
<LI>How much time did you spend on this MP, including team meetings, 
planning and design, and debugging? </LI>
<LI>What kinds of defects (bugs) did you find during the development 
of the program? When did you discover these defects (during
code review, code inspection, or testing)? How did you find them?</LI>
<LI>What did you learn about working in teams?</LI>
<LI>What went well in your work on this MP?  What did not?</LI>
<LI>What you would do differently for the Final Project?</LI>
<LI>If you did the optional debugging exercises, then 
please comment on the usefulness of those exercises.
</UL>
<p>Your program will be graded according to the clarity of your design
and the quality of your documentation.</p>
