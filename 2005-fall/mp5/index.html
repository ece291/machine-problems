<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now all of the communications plugs the physical link, the
RS232 connector, is the simplest. I think it was discovered in 
the ruins at Pompeii -- the Romans probably used it to interface
with their data runners. It specifies voltages (plus and minus)
which are prehistoric. It even predates TTL. But it is all there
is. When forced back to bare copper and elemental, ASCII 
transmission, RS232 is always there, and we should be thankful,
because in the intricacies of the higher layers of communications
protocol lies a tower of Babel -- virtual plugs misted in 
indescribable complexity. 
-- Robert W. Lucky, <i>Lucky Strikes Again</i>, 1993.<p><b>Corrected November 2 2005: 
Remove EnableTI from the list of functions called by Task3</b></p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Working in a team, you will write a single program MP5 that implements a 
version of the classic game Connect Four
over the serial port.</p>

<P>Files for MP5 are on the <tt>V:</tt> drive in the directory <tt>V:\ece390\mp5</tt>.
In this directory are the program framework <tt>mp5.asm</tt> and a 
running version of the program <tt>mp5lab.exe</tt>. Lab versions of subroutines
are in <tt>libmp5.lib</tt>, which contains all subroutines of LIB291 plus 
libInit, libReceiveSrv, libTransmitSrv, libTask1, libTask2, libTask3,
libTask4, and libCircle. You will use mp5xit instead of dosxit.
You should start by copying these files to your home directory with the following command: <BR>
<TT>xcopy /s V:\ece390\mp5 W:\mp5</TT><BR>
You may download the files from the server as 
<A href="http://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece390/mp/mp5/mp5.zip">mp5.zip</A>  </p>

<p> Reading: Lab Notes, Chapter 12</p>

<H2>Program Specification</H2>
<p>Two copies of the program run on separate computers connected by a null modem cable.
One player sits at each computer. When the program starts, it first asks whether the
initial state is testing (0), choosing a move (1), or waiting for the other player (2).
The player at one computer should enter 1, and the player at the other computer should enter 2.
The first player is assigned red checkers, the second player black checkers.
</p>
<p>The program then prompts the player for a radius, in pixels, for circles that will be displayed.
</p>
<p>Next, the program displays a 6x8 yellow grid on a blue background. Players take turns
choosing columns of the grid; to choose one of the eight columns, the player clicks with
the mouse anywhere in that column. When a player chooses a column, a checker (represented
as a filled circle) of the player's color drops smoothly to the lowest unoccupied cell of the six
cells in that column.  The checker appears to move behind the horizontal grid lines.
The winner of the game is first player to place four checkers of the 
same color in adjacent cells vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
</p>
<p>
In testing mode, there is only one player, and the colors of the falling
checkers alternate between red and black, starting with red.
</p>
<p>
At any time, a player may send a text message to the other player.
The typed message appears one one line at the top of the display,
and the player may use the backspace key to correct errors. 
When the player presses the Enter key, the message is transmitted to the other player,
and it appears at the bottom of the other player's display.
</p>
<p>
When a player presses the ESC key, the program exits.
</p> 

<h2>Program Organization</h2>

<P>In this machine problem, the main procedure is provided for you.
You must write the code to replace the library subroutines 
libInit, libReceiveSrv, libTransmitSrv, libTask1, libTask2, libTask3,
libTask4, and libCircle.
You will replace these subroutines from the libmp5 library by deleting the 
statements that call the libmp5 subroutine and by adding your own code. 
Each subroutine that you write should match the output of the library 
subroutine exactly.</P>
<p>
You may use parts of your team members' subroutines for MP4, such as
Enq and Deq.
</p>
<p>
The program uses the following global variables:
<pre>SavCOff RESW    1                       ; Serial communication port vector
SavCSeg RESW    1
State   DB      0                       ; 0 = testing, 1 = your turn,
                                        ; 2 = waiting for other player
PColor  DB      1                       ; this player's color, 1 = red, 2 = black 
Radius  DW      8                       ; Radius of circles, 2 to 9
Board   RESB    48                      ; 6x8 array with game state
</pre>
There are also parameter lists for the 
Transmit Queue (<tt>TQList</tt>) and the Receive Queue (<tt>RQList</tt>).
</p>
<p><IMG SRC="mp5fig.jpg" width="694" height="405"></p>
<p>
The program operates in 320x200 graphics mode, with 200 pixel rows and 320 pixel columns.
The yellow grid has horizontal lines on rows 40, 60, 80, ..., 160 and vertical lines on
columns 80, 100, 120, ..., 240.  Each line is one pixel wide.
The interior of each of the 48 cells in the grid is blue and measures 19x19 pixels.
</p>
<p>
Each cell on the grid has a grid row numbered from 0 to 5 and a grid column
from 0 to 7.  The top left cell of each grid is at grid row 0 and grid
column 0.  The (r,c) entry of the <tt>Board</tt> array is -1 if the cell
at grid row r and grid column c of is unoccupied, or the color code of the
checker in that cell if it is occupied: 12 for red, 0 for black.  (See the
<tt>EQU</tt> declarations at the top of the <tt>mp5.asm</tt> program framework.)
</p>
<p>
The program uses <tt>INT 33h</tt> with <tt>AX</tt> = 3 to determine whether 
the player has pressed a mouse button.
The <tt>INT 33h</tt> instruction retrieves the position of the tip of the mouse cursor arrow.  
The position is given in pixels for the row (in <tt>DX</tt>) and column (in <tt>CX</tt>).
The row value is 0 to 199, but column value is in 0 to 639; divide the column value
by 2 to get number of pixels in 320x200 mode.
After the program determines that the player has pressed a mouse button,
the program should wait for the mouse button to be released before
proceeding.
</p>
<p>For text, the screen behaves as if there are 25 text rows and 40 text columns.
To display text on the screen, use <tt>INT 10h</tt> to move the cursor to the appropriate column of
row 0 (outgoing text) or row 23 (incoming text).
Then call dspout or dspmsg to display a character or an entire message.</p>
<p>
Packets are transmitted over the serial port between computers in two formats.
In each format, the last character is <tt>EOT</tt>, which in this program is 0FFh.
(Some standard packet formats use 04h, but we cannot do so here. Why not?)
<ul>
<li>Format 1: This format is used for text messages exchanged between players.
The first byte is 01h, the subsequent bytes are ASCII characters (up to 40
characters), and the last byte is the EOT character.</li>
<li>Format 2: This format is used to report the column chosen by a player.
The first byte is 02h, the second byte is the grid column number (0 to 7), and
the third byte is the <tt>EOT</tt> character.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>You may use without penalty the following subroutines, which are provided
in the <tt>mp5.asm</tt> program framework.
<ul>
<li>EnableTI -- Enable ready-to-transmit interrupts from the 8250 ACE</li>
<li>DisableTI -- Disable ready-to-transmit interrupts from the 8250 ACE</li>
<li>SerialInit -- Initialize the 8250 ACE with the baud rate and frame format</li>
<li>SerialReset -- Reset the 8250 ACE, disabling its interrupts</li>
<li>ComInt -- Part of interrupt service routine for serial communication port</li>
</ul>
</p>
<P>Your team will replace each of the subroutines listed below with your own code.
Document each subroutine with a header.

Init saves the old serial communication port interrupt vector and changes

<tt>INT 10h</tt> to select 320x200 graphics mode and draws the grid.
Init uses <tt>INT 33h</tt> to initialize the mouse driver and to display
the mouse cursor; the mouse cursor should be displayed only if <tt>State</tt>
is 0 or 1. (Why?)  Init initializes the <tt>Board</tt> array.

<h2>Optional Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>You may implement additional features. Be creative!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Working in Teams</h2>
<ul>
<li>Find an equitable division of labor among team members, but do not
assign sole responsibility for a subroutine to only one student.
For each subroutine, one student could be the primary developer and 
another student could be the primary tester.
All students should inspect code written by other team members</li>
<li>For each team meeting, one student should serve as the manager, and 
another as the recorder; these roles should rotate so that every student has a
chance to fill each role. 
<ul>
<li>The manager is responsible for finding a time and place
for the meeting. Starting October 27, substantial time will be allocated in
every lecture period for team meetings. Grainger Library has rooms
specifically designated for group meetings. 
At the meeting, the manager should encourage everyone to 
participate, ensure that all alternatives are adequately considered,
and keep discussions on task and on time.</li>
<li>The recorder is responsible for 
taking notes, summarizing the decisions in an e-mail to all team members, and
(for the Final Project) drafting the short document due that week.</li></ul>
<li>Team members should strive to be professional and civil to each other.
Disagreements should be based on facts and technical arguments, not on personal
prejudices.</li>
<li>At the first meeting, on October 27, all teams will formulate a team charter.
Guidelines for the team charter will be distributed in class on October 27.
</li>
</ul>

<H2>Friendly Advice</H2>
<UL>
<LI>The libmp5.lib file contains executable library subroutines for each of 
the routines that you need to implement. The library subroutines allow
you to run the program and understand how it works before you implement it. 
You can test your program with any combinations of your own code and library 
subroutines. You will receive credit only for the subroutines that 
you implement yourselves. </li>
<LI>You may define new memory variables as needed. Task1 can use an internal
buffer for the unsent message, and Task3 can use an internal buffer for
part of a packet.</li>
<LI>You may design and implement additional subroutines. For example, 
you could write a subroutine that shows a falling checker behind the grid
lines.  Be sure to modify the Calls lines in 
the headers of the subroutines that call these additional subroutines. 
<li>When drawing a falling checker on the screen, first hide the mouse
cursor, draw the shape, and then display the mouse cursor again. This maneuver
will prevent the mouse cursor from blocking the display of the falling checker.</li>
<li>To slow down the falling checker, you may insert a timing loop that
simply iterates without doing anything.</li>
<li>Each subroutine should save and restore any registers that it uses,
except for registers that deliver subroutine outputs.  The caller 
may use registers without outputs and expect them to remain unchanged. </li>
<li>Each interrupt service routine must save and restore registers that it uses,
possibly including <tt>DS</tt>.</li>
<li>Think carefully about which parts of the program should be critical sections.</li>
<li>To simulate the serial port on one computer, during development of MP5,
you may write a subroutine Port
that dequeues a byte from the Transmit Queue <tt>TQ</tt> (provided that this queue is nonempty)
and enqueues this byte onto the Receive Queue <tt>RQ</tt>.
</li>
<li>After MP5 terminates, if the DOS window fills the whole screen, use Alt-Enter
to return to a normal size window.
</li>
<LI>Monitor the Web Board for clarifications and help.</li>
<LI>START EARLY!</LI>
</UL>

<h2>Demonstration, Documentation, and Grading</h2>
<p>Demonstrate your program to an ECE 390 staff member, who may use mp5lab.exe
on one of the two connected computers.</p>
<p>Although each team will develop one program, each submission will be
individual, as in previous MPs. You will also submit confidential peer evaluations.</p>
<p>As before, keep an MP development log and write an individual cover memo,
which you should submit with the program after the demonstration.
The cover memo should address the following questions (not the same as for previous
MPs):
<UL>
<LI>How much time did you spend on this MP, including team meetings, 
planning and design, and debugging? </LI>
<LI>What went well in your work on this MP?  What did not?</LI>
<LI>What did you learn about working in teams?</LI>
<li>How did you benefit from other team members?</li>
<li>How did other team members benefit from you?</li>
<li>What changes will your team make in its work practices for the Final Project?
(Your team will be asked to consider whether its team charter should be
revised.)</LI>
</UL>
<p>Your program will be graded according to the clarity of your design
and the quality of your documentation.</p>

<p>Gradesheet:<br>
Functionality: 25 points <br>
Team charter: 5 points <br>
Style and documentation: 6 points<br>
Cover memo: 4 points<br>
Peer evaluations: 20 points<br>
</p>
Peer evaluations: 
Each student will submit a confidential evaluation of each other
member of the team. The evaluation will give 3, 2, 1, or 0 points
for Excellent, Good, Fair, or Poor performance on each of the four
primary criteria: quality, quantity, timeliness, and cooperation. 
Although an evaluation has a total of 12 possible points, the maximum
evaluation score will be 10; thus a student who is Excellent on two criteria 
and Good on two criteria will receive a score of 10. In a team of four, for each
student, the lowest peer evaluation score will be dropped, and the remaining
two scores will be summed for a maximum of 20 possible points.
In a team of three, for each student, the two peer evaluation scores
will be added, for a maximum of 20 possible points.
