<h2 align="left">Introduction
</h2>

<p align="left">In this MP, you'll be analyzing the efficiency of two different 
sorting algorithms by counting the number of comparisons and swaps that each 
algorithm makes on a given array of input numbers.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="mp2.jpg"></p>

<h2>Problem Description</h2>

<p>
Your program will be:
<ul>
<li>Obtaining user input from the keyboard
<li>Parsing the string of numbers into an array 
<li>Analyzing two different sorting algorithms
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Obtaining User Input</h2>
<p>
User input will be taken from the keyboard. As the user types characters, 
they will be added to the input buffer and displayed on the screen.  The 
input buffer can hold MAXCHARS characters; if the user attempts to type 
more characters, they should not be added to the buffer or displayed on
the screen.  Also, you should handle backspacing properly.  If the user
hits the Backspace key, a character should be removed from the buffer 
(allowed to be overwritten with the next typed character) and removed 
from the screen.  Make sure that the user does not backspace before the
beginning of the input buffer: this will incorrectly overwrite locations
on the screen, and worse, it could potentially corrupt variables in memory.
You must also handle ESC keypresses.  If the user hits ESC, the input 
loop should terminate, and you should return -1, which will tell the main 
function that the user wants to quit the program. Last, you should also terminate 
the input loop when the user hits the Enter key.  At this time, place a '$' at the 
end of the input string and return 0.

<h2>Parsing Input</h2>
<p>
Once you have the string in the input buffer, you need to parse it into an
array of numbers. This is much easier as it seems, thanks to the library
ASCBIN function. Take a look at the lab manual to see how it works - it
will save you a great deal of time.
</p>

<p>
To parse the input string, you need to traverse the entire string, pull
out one number at a time, convert it from ASCII to binary, and then store the
number into the array. Make sure to keep track of how many numbers you parse,
as the array can only hold MAXNUMBERS numbers.  If you parse MAXNUMBERS numbers
from the input string, do not parse any more.  Also, remember that the input 
string is '$' terminated, so you should also stop parsing when you reach a '$'.
If ASCBIN returns an error code (dl is nonzero), return -1 to indicate there 
was an error in parsing the input; otherwise, you should return either 'H' or 'I' 
depending on whether the user wants to perform a heap sort or an insertion sort.
</p>

<h2>Analyzing Sorting Algorithms</h2>

The following algorithm descriptions were taken from 
<a href="http://linux.wku.edu/~lamonml/algor/sort/">http://linux.wku.edu/~lamonml/algor/sort/</a>.

<h3>Heap Sort</h3>

<a href="http://www.math.luc.edu/~van/cs460/lecture13/">INFO ON HEAPS</a>

<p>
The heap sort is the slowest of the O(n log n) sorting algorithms, but unlike 
the merge and quick sorts it doesn't <em>require</em> massive recursion or multiple arrays
to work.  Recursion is fun, though, so we'll make you do it anyway.
</p>

<p>
The heap sort works as it name suggests - it begins by building a <a href="http://www.math.luc.edu/~van/cs460/lecture13/">heap</a> out of the data set, and then removing the largest item and placing it at the end of the sorted array. After removing the largest item, it reconstructs the heap and removes the largest remaining item and places it in the next open position from the end of the sorted array. This is repeated until there are no items left in the heap and the sorted array is full. Elementary implementations require two arrays - one to hold the heap and the other to hold the sorted elements. 
</p>

<p>
We will use in-place implementation to save the space the second array would require.
The algorithm "cheats" by using the same array to store both the heap and the sorted array.
Whenever an item is removed from the heap, it frees up a space at the end of the array 
in which the removed item can be placed. 
</p>

Here is the heap sort pseudocode:
<pre>
HeapSort(Array,Length)
begin
 int i

 // convert the array to a heap
 for i = Length/2 downto 1
 begin
  Heapify(Array,i,Length)
 end

 // sort the array by removing the largest value
 // from the heap and reconstructing the heap
 for i = Length-1 downto 1
 begin
  Swap(Array[1],Array[i+1])
  Heapify(Array,1,i)
 end
end

Heapify(Array,Current,Length)
begin
 int Left, Right, Largest
 
 Left  = Current*2
 Right = Left+1

 // set Largest to the index of the largest value between
 // the current location and its child locations
 if Left <= Length and Compare(Array[Left] > Array[Current]) then
  Largest = Left
 else 
  Largest = Current

 if Right <= Length and Compare(Array[Right] > Array[Largest]) then
  Largest = Right
 
 // if a child is larger than the current location, 
 // swap the values and continue construcing the heap
 if Largest != Current then
  Swap(Array[Largest],Array[Current])
  Heapify(Array,Largest,Length)
 end
end
</pre>

<p>
Notice that the heap sort pseudocode considers the array locations to be from 1 to Length, not from 0 to Length-1. 
This is required in order to calculate the child nodes of the heap properly - if you attempted to calculate the 
child indices of array location 0, you would obtain 0*2 = 0 and 0*2+1 = 1, which is incorrect (you should obtain 1 and 2, 
respectively).  You could modify the index calculations to handle an array indexed from 0 to Length-1, but it is 
conceptually easier to have the array indexed from 1 to Length, where the left child index is 2*i and the right child index is 2*i+1.
</p>

<p>
One more caveat about the pseudocode: the array indices are given in terms of locations in the array.  Remember that
the x86 ISA is byte addressable, meaning that each address corresponds to one byte in memory.  The array you will
be sorting, however, is an array of words.  Keep these facts in mind when writing your code.
</p>

<h3>Insertion Sort</h3>

<p>
The insertion sort works just like its name suggests - it inserts each item into its proper place in the final list. 
The simplest implementation of this requires two list structures - the source list and the list into which sorted 
items are inserted. To save memory, we will use an in-place implementation that works by moving the current item past 
the already sorted items and repeatedly swapping it with the preceding item until it is in place.
</p>

<p>
Like the bubble and selection sorts, the insertion sort has a complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>). 
Although it has the same complexity, the insertion sort is a little over twice as efficient as the bubble sort. 
</p>

Here is the insertion sort pseudocode:
<pre>
InsertionSort(Array,Length)
begin
 int i, j, Index

 for i = 0 to Length-1 
 begin
  Index = Array[i]
  j = i

  // determine where the value should be placed in the array
  while j > 0 and Compare(Array[j-1] > Index)
  begin
   Array[j] = Array[j-1] // don't swap values but count as swap
   j = j - 1
  end

  // place the value in its proper location in the array
  Array[j] = Index // don't swap values but count as swap
 end
end
</pre>

<p>
Notice that the insertion sort pseudocode considers the array locations to be from 0 to Length-1 as usual. 
However, the array index caveat from the heap sort pseudocode applies to the insertion sort pseudocode as well.
</p>

<h3>Analyzing the Algorithm Efficiencies</h3>

<p>
As previously stated, you will analyze the efficiencies of the two sorting algorithms by counting the number
of compares and swaps that each algorithm makes.  Note that you will only be counting compares and swaps
of array locations; other comparisons that do not deal with array locations, such as the j > 0 in the insertion 
sort pseudocode, should not be counted.  The compares and swaps that you should consider are identified by
Compare(...) and Swap(...), respectively.  There are two exceptions in the insertion sort pseudocode where you
do not swap the numbers but you treat the array modification as a swap anyway.  Use the <em>CompareCount</em> and 
<em>SwapCount</em> variables to keep track of the number of comparisions and swaps, respectively.
</p>

<h2>C-Style Procedures</h2>
<p>
Each of the subroutines you will write in this MP are C-Style procedures.  Check out John Lockwood's
<a href="http://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece291/lecture/lockwood/l8.html">lecture on C-Style Procedures</a> for 
a description on how they work.  Some notes on his lecture:

<ul>
 <li>NASM by default makes NEAR calls, not FAR calls. Thus, only the IP gets pushed onto the stack. As a result,
     the leftmost parameter will be located at <strong>[bp+4]</strong>, not <strong>[bp+6]</strong> as indicated in the lecture.
     The next parameter will then be available at <strong>[bp+6]</strong>, and so on.</li><p>
 <li>You can disregard discussion of the allocation of local variables in the procedures.  You will not have to do so for this MP.</li><p>
 <li>It is not necessary to set DS=CS as is done in the example code.</li><p>
 <li>Only PUSH and POP SI, DI, SS, or DS if you use them.</li><p>

</ul>

<h2>&quot;Features&quot;</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The ASCBIN library function has a feature (not a bug) which incorrectly 
  sets the BX output when converting the number -32,768. Specifically, it points 
  BX to the 8 instead of the first character after the 8 as expected.
  This results in an extra 8 being added to the array when the input string is 
  parsed. So far, this is the only number that causes this error. If we 
  find others, we will list them here. These numbers will not be used when 
  testing your MP.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hints</h2>
<ul>
<li>The LIBMP2 file contains executable library functions for each of the
routines that you need to implement.  
This allows you to run the program and understand how it works before you implement it.  You can test your program with any combinations of your own
code and library functions.  You will only receive credit, however, for
the routines that you implement yourself.</li><p>

<li>When debugging your code in TD, you will find it helpful to use
the memory window to show you the memory location of the file and strings.
You can also use the watch window to keep track of variables in your code.</li><p>

<li>Do not assume that the file starts at memory location 0.</li><p>

<li>You may define new variables as needed.</li><p>

<li>Be very careful if you call another subroutine not to clobber the SI or DI registers
that the calling subroutine uses.</li><p>

<li>You need to create function headers for each of the functions you
  write.&nbsp; Function headers should include the name of the function, a description of the function's purpose, the list of inputs to the function, the list of the outputs, and any functions
  that the function calls.&nbsp; You will lose points if you do not do this!</li><p>

<li>START EARLY!</li><p>


<li>Monitor the <a href="http://my.ece.uiuc.edu/secure/webboard/select.asp?bid={38D8D827-70BA-4FB6-A186-3C9AD02FC672}">ECE291 Web Board</A> for clarifications and help.</li><p>

</ul>

<h2>Subroutines</h2>

<p>This assignment has six subroutines. You will receive credit by replacing 
each of these six subroutines listed below with your own code. </p>


<p>Each of the subroutines you will write in this MP are C-style. That
means the inputs to the subroutines (if any) are passed on the
stack. If the subroutine returns a value, the value will be in al or
ax, depending on the size. Also, any general purpose register other than SI and DI may be
overwritten: you do not have to preserve their vales, and you cannot assume the 
other subroutines (including the library subroutines) preserve them, either. 
Keep this in mind when writing your code - make sure that you preserve any necessary register 
values around subroutines calls that occur within other subroutines!</p>


<p>The size of the inputs, as well as the size of the return value, are included
in each subroutine definition. Pointers are denoted with asterisks (*), whereas
values do not have asterisks. If a subroutine does not have any inputs, <b>void</b>
will be present in the parentheses. Similarly, if the subroutine does not
return a value, it will be declared as <b>void</b> before the name of the
subroutine. </p>


<h3><b>word GetInput(word *Buffer)</b> </h3>
<ul>
<li>Obtains input from the user</li>

<li>Notes:
  <ul>
    <li>The input buffer can hold up to MAXLENGTH characters (includes spaces). Stop adding 
    characters to the input buffer when this limit is reached.</li>
    <li>You should correctly handle backspacing. If the user hits
      backspace, you should move the cursor back to the previous spot, and the
      character at that spot should be cleared from the screen. Also, make 
    sure that the user does not backspace past the beginning of the input 
    buffer.</li>
    <li>Terminate the input loop only when user presses the Enter key. 
    Also, add a '$' to the end of the input string when the input loop 
    terminates.</li>
  </ul>
<li>Points: 10</li>
