<p>You'll be implementing alpha blending, flood fill, and blur in this MP.</p>
<h2>Alpha blending</h2>
<p>There are two parts to the idea of alpha blending - the alpha part and the
blending part (ingenious, huh?).&nbsp; First we'll cover alpha opacity, then
we'll learn how to use this to combine images on the screen.</p>
<h3>Alpha Opacity</h3>
<p>A lot of people think of transparency when they hear the word
&quot;alpha&quot; in the context of graphics. They're right, sort of. Al<img alt="Figure A: Outlined Coverage of a Triangle on a pixel grid" src="triangle.png" align="right" width="360" height="270">pha
really refers to the opacity of a pixel, which is derived generally from the
coverage of a pixel.</p>
<p align="left">What is meant by the coverage of a pixel? Let's say you're
drawing a triangle. The bottom and the left of the triangle are horizontal and
vertical, respectively. The remaining side is at 45°. Now fill this triangle
with a blue color. Now draw it to the screen. The outline, zoomed in, is shown
in Figure A.</p>
<p align="left">Where are the 45° pixels? For that matter, if all these lines
go through the centers of pixels, chances are the left and bottom and
upper-right include a lot of half-covered pixels; the lower-left corner has a
one-quarter covered pixel and the two remaining corners have about a one-eighth
covered pixel, as visualized in Figure A.<br>
</p>
<h3 align="left">
<b>The Over Operation</b></h3>
<p>So how do you turn this into actual pixels? The simplest way, and the way
we're using, is called the over operation. To draw color A with coverage &#945;
over color B, the resulting color C is calculated as follows:</p>
<p>C<sub>r</sub> = (&#945;<sub>r</sub> * A<sub>r</sub>) + ((1-&#945;<sub>r</sub>)
* B<sub>r</sub>)<br>
C<sub>g</sub> = (&#945;<sub>g</sub> * A<sub>g</sub>) + ((1-&#945;<sub>g</sub>) *
B<sub>g</sub>)<br>
C<sub>b</sub> = (&#945;<sub>b</sub> * A<sub>b</sub>) + ((1-&#945;<sub>b</sub>) *
B<sub>b</sub>)</p>
<p>Or more succinctly, as we only have one &#945;, apply this to each channel
independently:<img alt="Figure B: Triangle Drawn with Over Compositions, alpha by coverage" src="triangle-over.png" align="right" width="360" height="270">
<p align="left">C = (&#945; * A) + ((1-&#945;) * B)<br>
C = (&#945; * A) + B - &#945; * B</p>
<p>When we apply this to the case as listed above, with coverage values one,
one-half, one-quarter, and one-eighth, we get something that looks like Figure
B, only not quite so zoomed in, and no grid.<br>
<br>
Things like this are where alpha opacity values originally come from. Don't
worry about how to calculate the alpha value, as the font image comes with an
alpha value for you. Concentrate on how to apply it using the over operator.</p>
<p>Here's how the value for the lower-left corner pixel was calculated, assuming
a white background (B) upon which you draw a pure blue pixel with 25% coverage:</p>
<div class="eqn">
  C = (&#945; * A) + ((1-&#945;) * B)<br>
  C = (0.25 * {0.0, 0.0, 1.0}) + (0.75 * {1.0, 1.0, 1.0})<br>
  C = {0.0, 0.0, 0.25} + {0.75, 0.75, 0.75}<br>
  C = {0.75, 0.75, 1.0}
</div>
<p>
Notice that the pixels in the font file are all black, with some of them being darker than
others.&nbsp; The lighter pixels have alpha values
closer to zero that distinguish them as such (<tt>0h</tt> is no coverage, while <tt>FFh</tt> is
total coverage).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wait... all the pixels are black?&nbsp; How will we be able to see the
characters on a black background? Can we get text of different color? Yes you
can.&nbsp; To do this, the easiest way is to set them manually by OR'ing the
pixel's RGB portion with a hex color value, making sure not to change the alpha
portion.&nbsp; So if you OR'ed a pixel with <tt>007F7F7Fh</tt>, you'd set its
color to gray. </p>
<p>We now introduce an optimized algorithm that uses MMX instructions to alpha
compose all four channels of a pixel at once:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Load two source pixels (8 bytes) from memory into an MMX register (8 bytes)</li>
  <li>Load two destination pixels (8 bytes) from memory into an MMX register (8 bytes)</li>
  <li>For each pair of source/destination pixels:
    <ol>
      <li>Unpack (bytes to words) the source pixel into an MMX register</li>
      <li>Copy out the source alpha byte into the four words of another MMX register</li>
      <li>Multiply the two previously mentioned MMX registers together</li>
      <li>Add the rounding factor to the previous result to round the upcoming
        division</li>
      <li>Shift each word right to divide by 256, thus fitting into a byte per
    channel (this calculates &#945; * A)</li>
      <li>Unpack (bytes to words) the destination pixel into an MMX register</li>
      <li>Add the results of the previous two steps (this calculates &#945; * A
        + B)</li>
      <li>Multiply the destination pixel by the source alpha</li>
      <li>Add the rounding factor to the previous result to round the upcoming
        division</li>
      <li>Shift each word right to divide by 256, thus fitting into a byte per
    channel (this calculates &#945; * B)</li>
      <li>Subtract the value of step 10 from the value of step 7, giving you (&#945; *
        A) + B - (&#945; * B)</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Pack (words to bytes) the two alpha-composed pixels back together with proper
    saturation in the correct order</li>
  <li>Write the composed pixels back to memory</li>
</ul>
<h2>Flood Fill</h2>
<p>The flood fill operation will fill a region of an image of one color with a
new color.&nbsp; The pseudocode for a 4-neighbor flood fill is given below:</p>
<p><tt>procedure floodFill(x, y, Color)<br>
begin<br>
&nbsp;if GetPixel(x, y) != Color then<br>
&nbsp; begin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; DrawPixel(x,y,newColor);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; floodFill(x+1,y,Color);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; floodFill(x-1,y,Color);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; floodFill(x,y+1,Color);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; floodFill(x,y-1,Color);<br>
&nbsp; end<br>
end</tt></p>
<p>Note that the algorithm is recursive.&nbsp; This algorithm will not work on
large areas, though, because the limited stack space limits the number of
recursive calls you can make.&nbsp; Thus, we will make the algorithm iterative
and create a queue in main memory to hold the points.&nbsp; We will use two
pointers, _QueueHead and _QueueTail, to point to the head and tail of the queue,
respectively.&nbsp; To enqueue a point, place it at the location of [_QueueTail],
and then add 4 to [_QueueTail] (2 points * 2 bytes/point).&nbsp; To dequeue a
point, read out the point located at [_QueueHead] and add 4 to [_QueueHead].&nbsp; When _QueueHead = _QueueTail,
no more points are in the queue, and the algorithm terminates.&nbsp; The
pseudocode for the updated algorithm is as follows:</p>
<p><tt>procedure floodFill(x, y, Color)<br>
begin<br>
&nbsp;Initialize _QueueHead to front of Queue;<br>
&nbsp;Initialize _QueueTail to front of Queue;<br>
&nbsp;Enqueue(x,y);<br>
&nbsp;OldColor = GetPixel(x,y);<br>
<br>
&nbsp;while _QueueHead &lt; _QueueTail<br>
&nbsp; begin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Point = Dequeue();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; if GetPixel(Point.x,Point.y) = OldColor and
GetPixel(Point.x,Point.y) != Color then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; begin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; DrawPixel(Point.x,Point.y,Color);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enqueue(Point.x+1,Point.y);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enqueue(Point.x-1,Point.y);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enqueue(Point.x,Point.y+1);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enqueue(Point.x,Point.y-1);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end<br>
&nbsp; end<br>
end</tt></p>
<h2>Blur</h2>
<p>Lastly, you will be able to blur the canvas image.&nbsp; This will be done by
taking a weighted average of the current pixel and its 8 neighboring
pixels.&nbsp; The weights are as follows, with a weight of 4 corresponding to
the current pixel:</p>
<pre>1 2 1
2 4 2
1 2 1</pre>
<p>Thus, the pixel's new value will be:</p>
<pre>NewValue = ( 1 * Upper-left neighbor +
             2 * Top neighbor +
             1 * Upper-right neighbor +
             2 * Left neighbor +
             4 * Current pixel +
             2 * Right neighbor +
             1 * Lower-left neighbor +
             2 * Bottom neighbor +
             1 * Lower-right neighbor ) / 16
             </pre>
<p>Use MMX instructions to do the above operations, making sure to use the
proper saturation.&nbsp; Use shifts to multiply and divide by powers of&nbsp;
two - this is faster than using pmul to multiply, and it is necessary to perform
division since there is no pdiv instruction.&nbsp; Also, you can't do an
in-place blur because pixels are updated as you go along, and this will affect
the values of the other pixels when considering their neighbors. So, you'll be
reading values from one image and outputting them to another.</p>
