<h2>Problem Description</h2>

<center><img src='screenshot.gif' width="652" height="431"></center><br>

<p>You are to create, through the course of this MP, a tile-based game
that takes place in a world sized 40 by 20 tiles.  On the screen at any
one time you can see 19 by 11 of these tiles - roughly one fourth of the
world.  You will move your character by pressing the arrow or numeric
pad keys in the four or eight directions.  You will fire arrows by
positioning your mouse in the direction you wish to fire and clicking.
You will see other people in the same world appropriately on your
screen.  When your arrow strikes another person, your counter
increments.

<p>&quot;How do I do all this?&quot; will likely be one of the first
things going through your mind, accompanied by &quot;Cool!&quot; and
&quot;Those sadistic TAs . .&quot;.  But your first question is not in
vain: here are the pieces which you need to create to form your working
MP.  The order you code them shouldn't matter, as long as you duplicate
successfully the functionality of the library code.  

<ul>
 <li><a href='#screen'>Screen Handling</a>
 <li><a href='#image'>Image Loading</a>
 <li><a href='#input'>Input Handling</a>
 <li><a href='#logic'>Game Logic</a>
 <li><a href='#net'>Network Communication</a>
</ul>

<p>You are suggested to follow something like the order in this writeup,
for maximum coding before incompatibility problems, however.

<a name='screen'><h3>Screen Handling</h3></a>

<p>Graphics Mode 13h is a 320x200, 256 color mode, which is very
convenient to use.  See <a
href='http://www.ece.uiuc.edu/ece291/lecture/l17.html'>Lecture 17</a>
for more information (a refresher perhaps?) on Mode 13h.  Simply write a
value from 0 to 255 in the appropriate offset, and your color appears on
the screen in the chosen palette color.  There are three things we have
to take into account here:
<ul>
 <li>Mode 13h is paletted!</li>
 <p>This means that despite being able to put a palette entry for any of
 2^18 available colors, we have to choose 256 of them for any given
 time.  When would this be a problem?  Imagine two pictures - one of a
 blue room and one of a pink room.  Each could easily take hundreds of
 colors to describe faithfully.  Either alone could have a great palette
 for screen representation.  However, with both on screen, they have to
 share the same entries.

 <p><em>If entry 1 in image A is a bright green, it had better be a
 bright green in image B!</em>

 <p>What this comes down to is you have to choose one palette that can
 suit all images on the screen.  We've done this for you, but if you
 want to replace the "artwork" of our game, keep this in mind.  In
 professional games that use Mode 13h, they can switch palettes for
 different scenes in the game, so the 256 color limit does not seem very
 limiting.

 <p>You will need to set up the palette using the VGA palette registers
 in <a href="procedures.html#graphicsinit">GraphicsInit</a>.  This is done
 using the following procedure (assuming PaletteData is loaded with the
 palette entries as stored in a PCX file: RGB, 1 byte for each color component,
 for each of the 256 palette entries):
 <ul>
  <li>Output a zero byte to port 3C8h to prime the palette registers.</li>
  <li>Loop through all 256 palette entries (3 bytes each), and output
  their R, G, B values, in that order, to port 3C9h.</li>
  <li>Not only should you be outputting byte values to port 3C9h, but those byte
  values must be in the range 0-63.  The PCX file format stores the palette
  color components as byte values, ranged 0-255.  Therefore, you need to divide
  each color component by 4 (use a shift!) before outputting it to port 3C9h.</li>
  <li>After you have looped through all 256 palette entries, you're done!</li>
  <li>Hint: try simply outputting each byte, 0-767, of the PaletteData array
  to port 3C9h (don't forget to divide each array entry by 4 before outputting
  it), after priming the palette registers.</li>
 </ul>

 <br><br>
 <li>Performance of  Memory-mapped I/O</li>
 <p>If you thought memory access is slow (which, compared to register
 access, it is!), you should see how slow the Memory-mapped I/O is!
 It's not awful, but you have to be careful how you do it, or there are
 some nasty screen side-effects.

 <p>Flicker.  If you've ever played a Nintendo game, and seen your
 characters flashing on and off the screen (when they weren't supposed
 to) this is flicker.  It occurs because the monitor scans between when
 you have refreshed the background and when you draw the foreground.
 Then it scans again after everything is fully drawn.  Ugly.

 <p>Double Buffering is a technique which handily allows you to deal
 with these two worst problems.  Since video memory appears as a 64k
 block of memory, you just allocate your own 64k block of buffer memory.
 You do all your work there - re<a href='procedures.html#drawmap'>draw
 your background</a>, re<a href='procedures.html#drawplayers'>draw all
 characters</a>, re<a href='procedures.html#drawarrows'>draw all
 arrows</a>, re<a href='procedures.html#drawmouse'>draw the mouse
 cursor</a> - and then you <a href='procedures.html#refreshscreen'>copy
 it all at once</a> to actual video memory.

 <p>Oddly enough, this is actually faster - as batch writes to video
 memory can be sped up, and you only do it once per frame.  And it stops
 the nasty flicker, as there are no frames in video memory that have the
 background and not the foreground.

 <br><br>

 <li>Accessing Segments in Protected Mode</li>
 <p>What is a segment? In segmented (real-mode) memory access, it's
 something you shift to the left by 4 bits, and add to your offset to
 find a linear address.  In P-Mode, it's not quite that simple. 

 <p>In P-Mode where you had Segment Registers before (cs, ds, es), you
 now have Selectors.  They hold an index which instead of shifting by
 four, you perform a lookup to find the number you can add to your
 offset to form a linear address.

 <p>Once you have this magic number the addition of your offset
 functions identically, so to write to Memory-mapped I/O segment 0A000h,
 you need to get an index which looks up to this value.  And then it's
 visually identical to how you'd do this in real-mode.

 <p>To get this selector set up, just use the correct
 <a href='http://www.ece.uiuc.edu/ece291/class-resources/pmode/dpmi/api/310002.html'>
 <em>software</em> interrupt</a>.  And you're
 done.

 <br><br>
</ul>

<p>Okay, I lied.  There's one more piece: getting <a
href='procedures.html#setmode13'>in</a> and <a
href='library.html#SetModeC80'>out</a> of Mode 13h.  The program
won't start in Mode 13h, and similarly, it shouldn't end in Mode 13h.
These are just <em>software</em> interrupt calls, so there is no further
documentation here.

<a name='image'><h3>Image Loading</h3></a>

<p>Before you can draw all these images to the screen, you have to get
them from somewhere.  Some games include them in the executable, some in
a large single data file, and some as easily-tampered-with individual
standard-format data files.

<p>We're using the last, as it's simplest: a PCX file of tiles for an
individual element.  Take a look at arrows.pcx, font.pcx, mouse.pcx and
players.pcx to see what they hold..

<p>The things you have to know for implementing this are:

<ul>
 <li>Opening, Reading from, and Closing a file</li>

 <p>The four steps you must follow to get an image into memory from a
 PCX data file are:
 <ol>
  <li>Open the file</li>
  <li>Read the file into a buffer</li>
  <li>Close the file (release the filehandle)</li>
  <li>Decode the data into desired location</li>
  <li>Optionally save the palette</li>
 </ol>

 <p>File handling in protected mode is rather complex, as it's necessary to
 copy the file data through a buffer in the lower 640KB of RAM.  Because of
 this added complexity of protected mode, we have provided library functions
 that open, read, and close files for you.  See the <a href="library.html">
 Library Reference</a> for details.

 <br><br>
 <li>Decoding PCX RLE compression (bonus)</li>

 <p>Once you have the PCX file data in the scratch buffer, you want to
 decode the image into the appropriate, allocated, graphic data blocks.
 Specifically, the tiles for the map go into TileImages, The mouse
 cursor image goes into MouseImage, the player pictures into
 PlayerImages, and the arrow images into ArrowImages.

 <p>There are many references available for decoding PCX files.  The lab
 manual has Real-Mode assembly source code to decode and display a
 320x200 image to the screen.  You are welcome to adapt that code to the
 purposes needed in this MP.  Be warned, however, that as a general rule
 translating code from Real Mode to Protected Mode can be more effort
 than it is worth, and sometimes it is better to write code from scratch
 rather than trying to translate it. For more information on PCX
 encoding (as well as BMP), see <a
 href='http://www.ece.uiuc.edu./ece291/lecture/l22.html#pcx'>Lecture
 22</a>

</ul>

Just load the appropriate pictures into memory, and make sure the rest
of the program knows where they are.  And that's it.  Dont' forget to
save the palette from one of the pictures into PaletteData so that
GraphicsInit can initialize the VGA palette.

<a name='input'><h3>Input Handling</h3></a>

<p>Now things start to get more complicated.  Because we must write
Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs) which are called automatically, we
have to make sure they are available at all times.  Thus we must Lock
the ISR, and all memory it depends on (variables it reads or modifies),
in active memory.  If we don't, the operating system may choose to swap
them out, and things get ugly if the interrupt is called at such a time.

<p>After that, an interrupt handler seems much like the one you wrote
for MP3.  The installation is easier, thanks to the <a href="library.html">
library routines</a>. So
ensure your memory is locked, and you're practically done.  Use the
<a href="library.html#LockArea">LockArea</a> library function to lock memory.

<ul>
 <li>Keyboard Input</li>

 <p>As in MP3 you need an <a
 href='procedures.html#installkeyboard'>installation</a>, <a
 href='procedures.html#removekeyboard'>removal</a>, and <a
 href='procedures.html#keyboardisr'>handling</a> procedure to render
 the keyboard usable in the fashion we desire. 
 
 <p>The installation and removal procedures are extremely short.  If
 you have more than a handful of lines for either, you're probably going
 about it incorrectly.  The actual handler is surprisingly not much more
 complicated, as all processing of non-exit keys is done in the main
 loop.  Toss the scancode of the pressed key in the variable CurrentKey.

 <p>(Just a quick note: that last bit about tossing the scancode into
 CurrentKey has one advantage/disadvantage combination.  When you
 release a key, the scancode is the same as the scancode for the pressed
 key, or'd with 80h (first bit set).  Thus in the main loop, you know
 when the key has been released.  Unfortunately, if you for instance
 press left then up, then release left, this simple scheme acts as if
 you have no keys down.  A more robust scheme might track this and still
 report the up key as being pressed, but you don't have to do this for
 this MP.)

 <br><br>
 <li>Mouse Input</li>

 <p>Again, for handling the mouse you need procedures for <a
 href='procedures.html#installmouse'>installation</a>, <a
 href='procedures.html#removemouse'>removal</a>, and <a
 href='procedures.html#mousecallback'>handling</a> the mouse data.

 <p><strong>But!</strong></p>

 <p>The mouse handler isn't truly a handler at all.  It's a callback.  A
 callback is the best of both worlds: it gets called like a normal
 procedure, getting all data in standard places instead of having to
 perform odd I/O to get it; yet it is also called in interrupt fashion -
 only, and immediately, when data is available.

 <p>Or to look at it slightly less positive way, it's still called from
 an interrupt, so you have to be careful about what you call -
 particularly no DOS interrupts.

 <p>Luckily for you, the library does have a function available that gets
 a real-mode callback address for your protected mode callback:
 <a href="library.html#Get_RMCB">Get_RMCB</a>.  However, you will still need
 to tell the mouse driver to call the callback, and where the callback is.

 <ul>
  <li>Use Get_RMCB to get a real-mode callback address for MouseCallback.
  Save the segment and offset in MouseSeg and MouseOff</li>
  <li>Call the Mouse interrupt (33h), function 0Ch to have the mouse
  driver call your callback on left mouse button press/release and mouse
  movement.  You need to use <a href="library.html#DPMI_Int">DPMI_Int</a>
  library function to do this.  This is necessary because the mouse driver
  asks for the real-mode segment of the callback in ES, and you cannot set
  ES to a real-mode segment in protected mode.  Move the appropriate values
  into the DPMI_Regs structure (DPMI_EAX, DPMI_EDX, DPMI_ES, and the like),
  set BX to 33h, and call DPMI_Int.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>Removing the mouse callback is a matter of reversing your steps.
 <ul>
  <li>Again use the mouse interrupt, this time to tell the mouse not to
  call your callback - use segment:offset of 0000:0000 for "no callback"</li>
  <li>Then, use <a href='library.html#Free_RMCB'>Free_RMCB</a> to
  release the real-mode callback</li>
 </ul>

 <p>Now that you've got the callback installing, and removing, what does
 your actual callback have to do?  Again, very little - we're doing the
 actual processing of the data in the main loop.  So all the handler
 does is toss the data into the appropriate variables.
</ul>

<p>Voil&agrave; - you've got input.  Now you are controlling how the
game is told what you want to do.  Next step - make the game interpret
this data, and act upon it.

<a name='logic'><h3>Game Logic</h3></a>

<p>This is the part of the MP that starts to really make it the game
that it is.  Up until now, there was graphical handling, and getting
input from the user.  Now it has to all come together under some central
control.  Because this is a networked game, it has to follow some
stringent rules in order to be reasonably fair to all players (the
discussion of these rules comes in the <a href='#net'>Network
Communication</a> section).  

<p>The players have to move about the map.  The arrows also traverse the
map, but at a much faster rate (ever tried to outrun an arrow?).  The
game has to award points when a player's arrow collides with another
player.  And, very importantly, each computer involved in the game must
run at the same speed.


<ul>
 <li>Timing</li>

 <p>The speed issue may be less noticeable in our lab, because all
 computers in there are virtually identical.  But in a more diverse
 environment, different machines will have different amounts of power
 and loads, and thus would run the game at different rates if executing
 "as fast as possible."

 <p>The solution to this problem is to make use of the internal timer.

 <p>Do this by <a href='procedures.html#installtimer'>installing</a>, <a
 href='procedures.html#removetimer'>removing</a>, and <a
 href='procedures.html#timerisr'>handling</a> the timer interrupt, which
 naturally occurs 18.2 times a second.  Many games in the past required
 speeding up this timer to allow sub 18th-of-a-second precision in event
 timing, but our network game doesn't need this.  You are welcome to
 refer to the information in the lab manual or in <a
 href='http://www.ece.uiuc.edu./ece291/lecture/l14.html#TIMEDEMO'>Lecture
 14</a> for more information.

 <p>The handler is another extremely short one.  Increment CurrentTime
 so we can find the current relative time immediately.  And then The One
 Most Important Consideration for the handler: the original handler must
 execute - many necessary OS activities hinge off the 18.2 times a
 second interrupt handler.  If you in another program speed up the
 timer, make sure to have the original timer execute only at the standard 18.2
 times a second.  Check the <a href='procedures.html#timerisr'>procedure
 information</a> for more on how exactly you get the original handler to
 execute - a process called "chaining."

 <p>This next part is handled in the main loop.  As this is given to
 you, you won't need to code this.  Make sure you understand it,
 as questions about this are fair game at handin time.

 <p>(As we are arbitrarily defining our game universe, we can afford to
 be "sloppy" - at least to the extent that in the next few given values,
 we're considering the timer interrupt to occur 18 times a second.
 This is incorrect, but just bear with it - the values are much easier
 to deal with this way.)

 <p>That said, the values we're concerned with are as follows:
 <ul>
  <li>The player can move (up to) 6 times a second</li>
  <li>The player may fire an arrow (up to) 2 times a second</li>
  <li>The arrows must be moved at a rate of 18 times a second</li>
 </ul>

 <p>To do this, keep track of the previous CurrentTime value that each
 operation was performed in the variables LastPlayerMoveTime,
 LastFireTime, and LastArrowMoveTime.  If it has been at least 3 timer
 ticks since the last player movement and the player is requesting to
 move, move the player.  If it has been at least 9 timer ticks since the
 player fired an arrow and the player is requesting to do so, fire an
 arrow.  If it's been at least one tick since the arrows were moved,
 move the arrows (and only update LastArrowMoveTime according to the
 number of times you move the arrows).

 <p>(In this unlikely case of being more than one clock tick since
 LastArrowMoveTime, you will probably want to move the arrows one
 position at a time, checking for collisions at each update, and
 incrementing the LastArrowMoveTime each time you update it.  Written
 properly this takes no extra logic.  This is only so extremely
 important because of the network nature of this game - see if you can
 explain why.)

 <br><br>
 <li>Firing the arrows</li>

 <p><a href='procedures.html#firearrowlocal'>Firing an arrow</a> is a 4
 step procedure:

 <ol>
  <li>Test MouseButtons to make sure the button has been pressed</li>
  <li>Find the first available arrow descriptor</li>
  <li>Insert the appropriate information (location, heading)</li>
  <li>Set the arrow to active</li>
 </ol>

 <p>Iterate through the Arrow structure testing the high bit of the
 Flags element.  Our setup guarantees that there will be one, as you can
 fire two arrows a second, and they extinguish after a maximum of
 START_ARROW_DISTLEFT (5) units, and fewer if they hit an opposing
 player.  Regardless, it is a good coding practice to put in the
 necessary checks to handle being called without an available arrow
 descriptor.

 <p>Now that we've got an arrow descriptor, figure out the direction the
 arrow needs to travel.  We do this by performing math on the mouse
 cursor's location as stored in MouseX and MouseY.  Ideally we would
 want to shoot directly at the mouse cursor.  In our program, however,
 we are avoiding the trouble of this by quantizing the directions to 8
 - the four horizontal and vertical directions, and the 45&deg; angles
 inbetween: the directions shown in solid black in Fig. A.

 <div align='center'><img src='figa.gif' width='320' height='200'><br>Figure A</div>

 <p>To make this feasible for the player, we'll allow anywhere between
 the blue lines to count as the closest solid black direction.  While
 ideally these would be on the 22.5&deg; separations halfway between the
 90&deg; and 45&deg; black lines (shown as red lines in Fig. A), that
 requires trigonometry to calculate.  We'd rather be more efficient, if
 a little less precise, and instead use the lines X=2*Y and 2*X=Y as our
 boundaries (shown as blue lines in Fig.  A).  As this creates a smaller
 diagonal zone than the perfect 22.5&deg; angles, we'll consider the
 boundary to be part of the diagonal zone.

 <p>As this is symmetric, let's look at the quadrant 1 cases.  (Hint:
 one way to structure your code is to only consider this case, after
 already figuring the sign of your X and Y coordinates.)
 
 <ul>
  <li>First we center the coordinates around our player by subtracting
  160 from MouseX, and 100 from MouseY.</li>
  <li>Then, if abs(X) &gt; abs(2*Y), use the horizontal trajectory (Red
  in Fig. B).</li>
  <li>Else, if abs(Y) &gt; abs(2*X), use the vertical trajectory (Blue
  in Fig. B).</li>
  <li>Else, use the diagonal trajectory (Green in Fig. B)</li>
 </ul>

 <div align='center'><img src='figb.gif' width='320' height='200'><br>Figure B</div>

 <p>Finally, update LastFireTime.

 <br><br>
 <li>Moving the arrows</li>

 <p>To <a href='procedures.html#movearrows'>move the arrows</a>, the
 following 5 steps must be followed for each of the arrows in the
 structure.

 <ol>
  <li>Test if the arrow is active.  If not, skip to the next arrow.</li>
  <li>Add the arrow's deltaX and deltaY to it's MapX and MapY</li>
  <li>Check for "Map Collision" - if the arrow is now on an impassable
  location, deactivate it.</li>
  <li>Check for "Player Collision" - if the arrow hits a player, the
  player who fired it gets a point. (The point only needs to be added for your
  arrows striking other players.)</li>
  <li>Update the distance remaining - if the arrow's DistLeft becomes
  zero on the decrement, deactivate it.</li>
 </ol>

 <p>To perform these checks and updates, the appropriate information
 must be extracted from (and repackaged into) the arrow structure.  Doing
 this requires a bit of NASM STRUC knowledge:
 <ul>
  <li>Remember: Everything in NASM is a label, and <tt>STRUC</tt>'s are just built-in macros.</li>
  <li>Also remember that NASM allows "local" labels by prepending a <tt>.</tt> to the label name.</li>
  <li>If you look at the <tt>STRUC</tt> definition for Arrow, you'll see it has a field called
  <tt>.Flags</tt>.  This can also be referred to as <tt>Arrow.Flags</tt>.</li>
  <li><tt>Arrow.Flags</tt> has the effective value of 0 because it is the first item in the structure.</li>
  <li>Because it is just a number, you can add it to an address with no problems:</li>
  <li><tt>mov al, [Arrows+esi*4+Arrow.Flags]</tt> would put the flags for the esi'th arrow into al.</li>
  <li>This addressing format works for all structures in NASM.  See the NASM documentation (V:\Nasm Docs.hlp)
  for more information.</li>
 </ul>

 <br>
 <li>Hit detection</li>

 <p>Hit detection is very straightforward.  If the arrow, on update, will
 move into a location where a player is standing, then deactivate the player,
 deactivate the arrow, and give a point to the local player if it was your
 arrow (don't bother adding points for other players).  This is just as easy
 to check as map collisions are because PlayerMap contains all the players
 projected onto it.  Just use the same offset you calculated for a map collision
 to check for a player collision!

 <br><br>
 <li>Moving the players</li>

 <p><a href='procedures.html#moveplayerlocal'>Moving the players</a> is
 much like moving the arrows.  For the local player, take the current
 location, and add the appropriate X and Y changes according to the
 keypress.  If this location is occupied by another player, cancel the
 movement.  If this location is an impassable tile on the map, cancel
 the movement.  Otherwise, update the Player's location.

</ul>


<a name='net'><h3>Network Communication</h3></a>

<ul>
 <li>Starting or joining a game</li>

 <p>This game uses broadcast NetBIOS, which is a serverless protocol.  Thus
 we don't need to worry about connecting to a specific address, we just join
 a broadcast group and anything that we send out onto the network is received
 by all other members of that group.

 <p>When the game is started, it runs NetworkInit.  All NetworkInit does
 is start up networking and try to obtain a player number.
 <ul>
  <li>If networking is not available or the game is full, NetworkInit should return -1.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, it should set LocalPlayerNum to reflect the player number on the network.</li>
  <li>You may test your code in a non-networked environment (it will probably be
  more reliable to test it this way) by uncommenting the 10 or so lines which
  set up a couple of sample players and make LocalPlayerNum = 0.</li>
 </ul>

 <p>Every two seconds, the main loop sends out a HELLO message to let the
 other clients know that we exist.  There is currently not a timeout feature
 if a client crashes, but it would be fairly trivial to add one because of the
 periodic HELLO message sends.

 <br><br>
 <li>Sending updates</li>

 <p>Every 9 times a second, or when an arrow is fired, the main loop sends out
 an UPDATE message which contains the Player struct and the Arrow structs for the
 local player and all of our arrows.  We also send our player number so that the
 other clients can identify who the Player and Arrow structures belong to.

 <br><br>
 <li>Receiving updates</li>

 <p>As every packet comes in, NetworkCallback is called to process the incoming packet.
 The network callback needs to do the following things:
 <ul>
  <li>Identify the packet type and process accordingly.</li>
  <li>If it is a HELLO packet:</li>
  <ol>
   <li>Copy the new player's Player structure into the proper position in the
   NetworkPlayers array.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>If it is an UPDATE packet:</li>
  <ol>
   <li>Copy the updated Player structure from the packet to the proper position
   in the NetworkPlayers array.</li>
   <li>Copy all of the Arrow structures from the packet to the proper positions
   in the NetworkArrows array.  Remember that the NetworkArrows and Arrows arrays
   are grouped by Player.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>If it is a GOODBYE packet:</li>
  <ol>
   <li>Clear active bits of the leaving player's Player struct and all their Arrow structures.
   (this needs to be done for both the Network and non-Network arrays)</li>
  </ol> 
 </ul>
 
 <p>In the main loop, the Network arrays are constantly copied as necessary to the non-Network
 arrays.  The reason why the packets don't go directly into the normal arrays is because a packet
 can come in at any time, even during the middle of the drawing of the screen.

 <br><br>
 <li>Leaving a game</li>

 <p>Before the network is shutdown, a GOODBYE packet needs to be sent out to notify the other
 clients that you are leaving the game and that all of your information can be thrown away.
 Shutting down the network driver frees your player name so it can be used by another machine
 (or the same machine if you immediately start up the MP again).
</ul>
