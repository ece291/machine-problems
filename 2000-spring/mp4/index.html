<a name='intro'><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
<em>This double-MP introduces many concepts.  Some of them are very
alien to the way the course has worked through now.  Reading through the
entirety of the MP writeup is highly suggested!</em>

<p>Having made your way through the previous four Machine Problems, and the
exam, you've shown yourself to be a true ECE 291 student.  Now you can
almost see the carrot dangling out there, just this double-MP, a final
project, and two exams away.

<p>So we're stepping up the difficulty - and the rewards are
commensurate.  Have you ever looked at what we're doing in assembly and
wondered how something like Quake is possible?  The sheer size alone is
daunting - how can you fit that in 64k?  You can't.  How about a few
segments, like you started using in MP3?  Nope - still too big.

<p>Hey wait!  What about the fact that text mode is obviously not up to
the task of representing a 3D world, much less a complex 2D world?

<p>Enter Protected Mode (often referred to as P-Mode), a powerful way of
gaining access to as much memory as the computer has to offer.  With
this power comes some limitations, and differences.  Right off the bat
you'll have to adjust to writing for <a href='http://www.cryogen.com/nasm/'>NASM</a>
instead of MASM.  Here's a <a
href='http://www.ece.uiuc.edu/ece291/archive/mp/f99/mp5/masm_nasm.html'>quick
reference</a> on the surface differences between the two.  Similarly,
you are welcome to read through the <a
href='http://www.ece.uiuc.edu/ece291/archive/mp/f99/mp5/tutorial.html'>entire
MP tutorial</a>.  For more about the development environment (and how to install
it at home), see <a href='http://www.ece.uiuc.edu/ece291/archive/mp/f99/mp5/dev_env.html'>
this page</a> from the tutorial.

<p>Be sure to read carefully through the preliminary procedure as some things
have changed from previous MPs.  This includes the build process, as you'll be
using tools that are much more like Unix tools (make and gcc) than the Microsoft
Unix-ish tools you've been using in past MPs.
<p>To help make the transition to protected mode easier, a large library has
been provided to you.  The documentation for all the library functions is
<a href="library.html">online</a>, and even the <em>entire</em> source code
is available in the MP's lib/ directory!  Please notice that all functions the
library provides and all the functions you will be writing for this MP conform
to the C calling convention.  This means the arguments are passed on the stack in
reverse order, you are free to modify (without saving) eax, ebx, ecx, and edx
(this also means that you should not expect these registers to be preserved when
calling a library function), and the return value is in eax/ax/al (depending on
its size).
<a href="http://www.ece.uiuc.edu/ece291/archive/mp/f99/mp5/lib_intro.html#Pete's Proc and Invoke Macros">
A few macros</a> have been provided to make coding C procedures easier.  Also,
a very large library, written in assembly and with source, has been given to
you to make coding some parts of this MP much easier.  The source can be found
in the lib/ directory of the MP, and the <a href='library.html'>Library
Reference</a> is available online to help you find the functions you need.
<p>Also remember that you now have full usage of the <em>entire</em> Intel
instruction set, including all 32-bit registers and extended addressing modes.
This means that you are free to address with any register, and even have an
index register multiplied by a power of two, e.g.: mov eax, [edx+ecx*4+5].  You
can use this to your definite advantage when you need to multiply by 3, 5, or
9: just look up the LEA instruction and think about the advanced addressing
modes.  Don't forget that you can't access the high 16 bits of the 32 bit
registers directly, you either need to clear, shift, or load out of memory
to set those bits.  Feel free to look at the library source code for ideas
and examples of how to use the extended registers and addressing modes!
<p>The final three things that enter into play here are graphics, mouse
control, and networking.  The first two are amazingly easy to use, both
conceptually and otherwise.  There is a library for the third, but its
use can seem a little obtuse.  Time to move on to the Problem
Description pages, and then start programming.

<h2><a href='description.html'>Problem Description</a></h2>
<h2><a href='procedures.html'>The Procedures</a></h2>
<a name='prelim'><h2>Preliminary Procedure</h2></a>
<ul>
<li>
Copy the given MP4 files from the network drive to your home directory
with the following command:</li>

<br><tt>xcopy /s V:\ece291\mp4 W:\mp4</tt>
<br>Alternatively, from home you can download the same files as <a href="http://www.ece.uiuc.edu/ece291/mp/mp4/mp4.zip">mp4.zip</a>.
<li>
<B>Unlike previous MP's</B>, you need to run V:\djgpp\djgpp.bat before building
your program (only once per DOS session!).<br>Run
<tt>make</tt> to build an executable program
using the given ECE291 library functions.</li>

<li>
As with previous MP's, use a text editor to modify the program. As given,
the program uses LIBMP4 routines to implement all functionality. To receive
full credit for the assignment, you will need to implement each of the
subroutines described above with your own code.</li>

<li>
By modifying a few comments, you can mix and match usage of your own code
and Library routines. You may notice that the LIBMP4 routines contain extraneous
and difficult-to-read code. They are not meant to be easily unassembled!</li>
</ul>
<i>Monitor the newsgroup and this on-line section for revisions to the
MP or to the write-up</i>

<h2>Checkpoint</h2>

Because this MP is so large, we have made a checkpoint due a week before the
final due date.  You must turn the following procedures into a TA before the
checkpoint due date.  Print off the
<a href='mp4checkpoint.html'>Checkpoint Gradesheet</a> and
demonstrate to a TA that you have completed the procedures on it.  There will
be no early points for handing in the checkpoint early, but it is in your best
interest to do so, to give yourself more time on the remainder of the MP (and
time to complete the bonus procedures).  The checkpoint is worth <b>25%</b>
of your total MP grade, so don't forget to turn it in!

<h2>Final Steps</h2>

<ol>
<li>
Verify that your program meets all requirements for handin.</li>

<li>
Print a copy of the
<a href="mp4grade.html">MP4
grading sheet</a>.</li>

<li>
Demonstrate MP4.EXE to a TA or to the instructor.</li>

<li>
Be prepared to answer questions about any aspect of the operation of your
program. The TAs will not accept an MP if you cannot fully explain all
operations of your code.</li>

<li>
Handin in your program by running:</li>

<br><tt>A:\Handin </tt><i>YourWindowsLogin</i>
<li>
Print your MP4.ASM 4 pages per page and double sided.
If you don't know how to do this ask a TA for assistance.</li>

<li>
Staple the MP4 grading sheet to the front of your MP4.ASM file and give
both to the same TA that approved your demonstration.</li>
