Problem Description</h2>

<center><img SRC="mp3grafx.jpg" BORDER=0 height=533 width=834></center>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font size="3">Conceptually,
  blackjack is a very simple game.&nbsp; The game starts out by the dealer
  dealing himself two cards (only the second of which is shown to the player),
  and dealing two cards to the player.&nbsp; Then it is the player's turn.&nbsp;
  The player then decides whether to &quot;hit&quot; or &quot;stay.&quot;&nbsp;
  If the player chose to hit, then he has chosen to get another card.&nbsp; If
  they chose to stay, then they have decided that they like their score.&nbsp;
  After the player's turn, it is the dealer's turn.&nbsp; The dealer is very
  much like the player, with one major difference.&nbsp; For the dealer, if his
  score is above 15, then they can not hit.&nbsp; If it is below 16, then the
  dealer MUST hit.</font><p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The object of the
  game is to get as close to a score of 21 without going over.&nbsp; The cards
  are scored as follows:&nbsp; number card = number on card, face card = 10
  points, ace = 1 or 11 points.&nbsp; If the player gets an ace and a face card
  off the initial deal, then it is called &quot;blackjack.&quot;&nbsp; The
  player automatically wins.&nbsp; The other ways the player wins are if the
  player has a higher score than the dealer, if the player gets five cards
  without going over 21, or if the dealer's score is over 21 (known as
  &quot;busting&quot;).</font><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="3"> Obviously, if
  the player busts, then he loses.&nbsp; If you disagree with the rules of
  blackjack at the 291 casino, then you will be kindly (if you're lucky)
  escorted out of the building.</font><p><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For
  this MP, you will be implementing a version of this game in text mode video.</font><br>
</blockquote>
<h2>
Implementation</h2>
<i>A word about Interrupt Service Routines</i>:
<ul>
<li>
In MP2, we used LIB291's <tt>kbdine</tt> to read data from the keyboard.
Calling this function causes your computer to poll the default keyboard
handler until a key is read into the DOS keyboard buffer.</li>

<li>
For this MP, we don't want to have to continuously poll the keyboard.&nbsp;
Thankfully, in assembly it is easy to write your own interrupt service
routines.&nbsp; This could come in handy if you wanted to have an asynchronous
input from multiple devices.&nbsp; We would not like to have to wait on
the keyboard input while other devices may be trying to offer input as
well.</li>

<li>
The use of customized interrupt service routines (interrupt handlers) allows
the program to handle <i>asynchronous I/O</i>. With asynchronous I/O, the
program is able to do other things while waiting for data from one particular
input.&nbsp; In this MP you are required to watch for inputs from&nbsp;
the keyboard.</li>

<li>
The subject of ISRs is discussed in lectures 13 through 16.&nbsp; Read
the lecture notes and Chapter 9 in the lab manual for more information.</li>

<li>
The card array is stored thusly (in the cardArray variable) :&nbsp;
<ul>
  <li>(0 - 12)&nbsp;&nbsp; : Hearts (0-8 = numbers 2 to 10, 9 = Jack, 10 =
    Queen, 11 = King, 12 = Ace)</li>
  <li>(13 - 25) : Diamonds (13 - 21 = numbers 2 to 10, 22 = Jack, 23 = Queen, 24
    = King, 25 = Ace)</li>
  <li>(26 - 38) : Clubs (26 - 34 = numbers 2 to 10, 35 = Jack, 36 = Queen, 37 =
    King, 38 = Ace)</li>
  <li>(39 - 51) : Spades (39 - 47 = numbers 2 to 10, 48 = Jack, 49 = Queen, 50 =
    King, 51 = Ace)</li>
  <li>A previously drawn card will have a value of 1, whereas an undrawn card
    will have a value of 0.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Because of the fact that aces can count as 1 or 11, we need to keep track of
  two scores for the player.</li>
<li>The ASCII values for the suits (the picture representations of each):
  <ul>
    <li>Hearts = 03h</li>
    <li>Diamonds = 04h</li>
    <li>Clubs = 05h</li>
    <li>Spades = 06h</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>In order to generate a random number from 0 - 51, you must first get a
  random number from the computer's timer.&nbsp; This can be done using
  interrupt 21h (read on 21h to see which subfunction does this).&nbsp; Then, in
  order to convert it to the range, we need to use a modulus operator (no, there
  is no modulus opcode).&nbsp; This can be done using the DIV command.&nbsp;
  This same principle must be used to convert a card in the range 0 to 51 into a
  card within a suit.&nbsp; The DIV command will give the suit in one output
  register, and the card within that suit in the other.&nbsp; It is up to you to
  determine what number we need to divide these values by.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Procedures</h3>

<ul>
<li>
This assignment has twelve procedures. You will receive credit for this
assignment by replacing each of the twelve procedures listed below with
your own code.</li>

<li>
Experiment with the working code to gain a full understanding of how the
program works.</li>

<li>
Use defined constants/variables where appropriate.</li>

<li>
Comment ALL the functions and make sure that they preserve all register
values.&nbsp; Be sure to include function headers for ALL functions that
you write.</li>

<li>
For a gold star, implement &quot;splitting&quot; for the player's hand.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b><font size=+1>KbdInstall</font></b></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Inputs :</b> None</li>

<li>
<b>Outputs : </b>oldKbdV updated</li>

<li>
<b>Calls : </b>None</li>

<li>
<b>Purpose :</b> The purpose of this function is to install your keyboard
handler to handle keyboard interrupts.&nbsp; This function saves the value
of the default keyboard routine in the variable oldKbdV.</li>

<li>
<b>Notes :</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Code this routine at the same time as KbdUninstall.</li>

<li>
Use DOS interrupt 21h to read and set the handler vector.</li>

<li>
While coding this function, have it point to libKbdHandler.&nbsp; Only point it
to KbdHandler if you have implemented the handler.</li>

<b>Purpose :</b> This function is the new keyboard handler that you are
writing for the program.&nbsp; It updates the flags according to what key
was pressed by the user.</li>

<li>
<b>Notes :</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
<b>DO NOT CALL THE DOS HANDLER.</b></li>

<li>
Your code should reset the PIC.</li>

<li>
exitFlag signifies when the user wants to exit the program, drawCard is
when the user wants to "hit," stayPlayer is when the user wants to "stay,"
and spaceFlag is used for when the program should wait until spacebar is
pressed before continuing.</li>

<li>
See the lab manual for an example of a keyboard handler.</li>

<li>
Be sure to save all registers.</li>

<li>

<li>
<b>Purpose : </b>This function performs several necessary operations.&nbsp;
First it resets all variables to their conditions at the start of a game.&nbsp;
Then it "shuffles" the deck.&nbsp; It also draws the first two cards for
each player, displaying all but the first card drawn by the dealer.&nbsp;
After each card drawn, it recalculates the score for the person who drew
the card, and if it was the human player, it then displays the new score.</li>

      <li><font size="3">Exiting the program should work from any of the
        functions that you write (you may need to check for this condition in
        any function).&nbsp; This should also still work even while in a wait

      <li><font size="3">Observe the TA solution for a few games to see how the
        general flow of the game proceeds.</font></li>
      <li><font size="3">Remember that you should only count the highest player
        score under or equal to 21 (check for which score you should use).</font></li>

<b><font size=+2>Preliminary Procedure</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
Copy the given MP3 files from the network drive to your home directory
with the following command:</li>

<br><tt>xcopy /s V:\ece291\mp3 W:\mp3</tt>
<br>Alternatively, from home you can download the same files as <a href="http://www.ece.uiuc.edu/ece291/mp/mp3/mp3.zip">mp3.zip</a>.
<li>
As with previous MP's, run <tt>NMake</tt> to build an executable program
using the given ECE291 library functions.</li>

<li>
As with previous MP's, use a text editor to modify the program. As given,
the program uses LIBMP3 routines to implement all functionality. To receive
full credit for the assignment, you will need to implement each of the
subroutines described above with your own code.</li>

<li>
By modifying a few comments, you can mix and match usage of your own code
and Library routines. You may notice that the LIBMP3 routines contain extraneous
and difficult-to-read code. They are not meant to be easily unassembled!</li>
</ul>
<i>Monitor the newsgroup and this on-line section for revisions to the
MP or to the write-up</i>
<h2>
Final Steps</h2>

<ol>
<li>
Verify that your program meets all requirements for handin.</li>

<li>
Print a copy of the <a href="http://www.ece.uiuc.edu/~ece291/mp/mp3/mp3grade.html">MP3
grading sheet</a>.</li>

<li>
Demonstrate MP3.EXE to a TA or to the instructor.</li>

<li>
Be prepared to answer questions about any aspect of the operation of your
program. The TAs will not accept an MP if you cannot fully explain all
operations of your code.</li>

<li>
Handin in your program by running:</li>

<br><tt>A:\Handin </tt><i>YourWindowsLogin</i>
<li>
Print&nbsp;<span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff"><font color="#0000FF">MP3.ASM</span></font>.
Make sure that you print out your code 4 pages per page and double sided.
If you don't know how to do this ask a TA for assistance.</li>

<li>
Staple the MP3 grading sheet to the front of your MP3.ASM file and give
both to the same TA that approved your demonstration.</li>
