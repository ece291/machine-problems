<H2>Introduction</H2>
In this MP we will investigate two sorting algorithms: The heap sort
and an implementation of the recursive quick sort.  We will then track
these sorting algorithms by outputting textual information to the user
so he can verify that not only does our sort finish correctly, it does
so by performing the proper steps.

<p>
Imagine looking up a telephone number in an unsorted telephone book.
Without having the data sorted, it would be necessary to scan though all
of the names in the book just to find an individual listing.  Searches
and queries for data can be performed far more quickly when the data set
we are searching through is in a known order.
<p>

Now imagine having the task of sorting all the names in the telephone
book.  Each step of the process involves comparing a pair of names and
determining which name should be listed before the other.  In the
algorithms like the heap sort and the quick sort, the running time of
the sort increases proportional to n * log(n), where n is the number of
items being sorted.  However, the proportionalities depend on both the
implementation of the algorithm and the data upon which the algorithm is
being performed.

<P>
<H2>
Sorting Algorithms: Heap Sort</H2>
The heap sort is a good choice in many situations, as it always performs
in O(n * log(n)) comparisons. It is based on the idea of partially
ordering a binary tree in O(n) comparisons, and then retrieving the top
element n times in an O(log(n)) operation.  Thus its best, worst, and
average running times are proportional to n * log(n).

<P>
To perform the heapsort, one must first have a representation of the
heap.  The most convenient representation for our purposes is that of a
linear array, as shown in Figure 1.  This has the advantages of being
able to always find a node's parent and children via simple math
applications on the indices. In our case, for a given node i, its children
are indexed as 2 * i and 2 * i + 1. <i>Note that array[0] is left unused</i>.

<div align='center'><img src='heap-tree.jpg' alt='Pictorial: Binary-Tree interpretation of an Array' width="378" height="270"></div>

<P>
The rules of a Heap dictate that a parent must always be of a larger
value than its children. Since our initial array is not guaranteed to
follow this rule, we must first turn the array into a valid heap. To do
this, we follow these pseudocode operations:

<div align='center'><table border><tr><td>
for <tt>i</tt> = <tt>heapsize</tt>/<tt>2</tt> downto <tt>1</tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;PercolateDown(<tt>i</tt>,<tt>heapsize</tt>)<br>
end for
</td></tr></table></div>

<p>
Then we must iterate through, removing the top element and placing it at
the endmost available position in our list, in the following manner:

<div align='center'><table border><tr><td>
for <tt>i</tt> = <tt>heapsize</tt>-<tt>1</tt> downto <tt>1</tt><br>
<font color='blue'>; place largest unsorted element in
                     sorted position</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;SWAP(Node(<tt>1</tt>), Node(<tt>i</tt>+<tt>1</tt>))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;PercolateDown(<tt>1</tt>,<tt>i</tt>)<br>
end for
</td></tr></table></div>

<p>
These are only valid with the proper PercolateDown function. It is used
to fix a heap with a known abberancy to the rules.  In our case, it will
always be a smaller value as a parent to a larger value. To return the
structure to a valid heap, merely compare with its children, swap as
necessary, and follow it down the tree. Note that the heapsize gets smaller
with every iteration. Pseudocode follows:

<div align='center'><table border>
<caption>PercolateDown(<tt>k</tt>,<tt>heapsize</tt>)</caption><tr><td>
<font color='blue'>; <tt>heapsize</tt> is the current heapsize,<br>
; which <strong>changes</strong> during the sorting iterations.</font><br>
while <tt>k</tt> &lt;= <tt>heapsize</tt>/<tt>2</tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color='blue'>; we have to also make sure if child2 exists or not</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if child1(<tt>k</tt>) &gt;= child2(<tt>k</tt>) <tt>or</tt> (<tt>k</tt>*<tt>2</tt> = <tt>heapsize</tt>) then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>c</tt> = <tt>k</tt>*<tt>2</tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>c</tt> = <tt>k</tt>*<tt>2</tt>+<tt>1</tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;end if<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if node(<tt>k</tt>) &lt; node(<tt>c</tt>) then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SWAP(Node(<tt>k</tt>), Node(<tt>c</tt>))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;k = c<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;end if<br>
end while<br>
</td></tr></table></div>

<H2>
Sorting Algorithms: Quick Sort</H2>
We now look at a recursive sorting technique called Quick Sort.
The basic algorithm for an array of integers is as follows:
<OL>
<LI>

<I>Partitioning Step:</I>&nbsp; Choose an element of the original array
of values (call it the <i>pivot</i>) and determine its final location in
the sorted array.  This is done by moving all values which are less than
the pivot to the left side of the array, and all values which are
greater than the pivot to the right side of the array. We now have one
element in its proper location and two unsorted sub arrays.</LI>

<LI>
<I>Recursive Step:</I> Perform step 1 on each unsorted array.</LI>
</OL>
Each time step 1 is performed on a sub array, another element is placed
in its final location of the sorted array, and two unsorted sub arrays
are created. When a sub array consists of one element, it must be
sorted, therefore that element is in its final location. 

<P>The basic algorithm seems simple enough, but there are two things we
must decide how to do first:
<ul>
<li><i>Choose a Pivot</i>
The choice of a pivot is important.  The optimal choice is the element
which is sorted to the middle of the array, as this leads to an n * log(n)
running time.  A bad choice for the pivot is an element which is placed
at one end of the array, as that leads to an n<sup>2</sup> running time.
See if you can visualize why, or ask a TA.</li>
<li><i>Find the final position of the pivot in the array</i>
How do we do this? As an example, consider the following set of values
(the element in bold is the pivot -- it will be placed in its final
position in the sorted array):
</ul>

<TABLE BORDER>
<TR>
<TD><TT><B>37</B></TT></TD>
<TD><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
4&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color='blue'>89</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8&nbsp;&nbsp; 10&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color='red'>12</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;
68&nbsp;&nbsp; 45&nbsp;</TT></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

Starting from the rightmost element of the array, compare each element
to <B>37</B> until an element less than <B>37</B> is found, then
starting from the left, compare each element to 37 until an element
greater than <b>37</b> is found. Make sure the elements you are
comparing do not cross.  Then swap both of these elements.  The first
element from the right less then <B>37</B> is <font
color='red'>12</font>, and the first element from the left greater than
<B>37</B> is <font color='blue'>89</font>.  Thus <font
color='red'>12</font> and <font color='blue'>89</font> are swapped. The
new array is:

<BR>&nbsp;
<TABLE BORDER>
<TR>
<TD><TT><B>37</B></TT></TD>
<TD><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
4&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color='red'>12</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
8&nbsp;&nbsp; 10&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color='blue'>89</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;
68&nbsp;&nbsp; 45&nbsp;</TT></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

Then, repeat this step, starting with the elements inward from those you
just swapped.  In this case, the first element less than <b>37</b> is
<font color='red'>10</font>, and the first element greater than <b>37</b>
does not occur before your indices cross.  Because your indices
crossed, it means your array is partitioned.  Now you must insert
<b>37</b> in its sorted position, and recurse on each of the two
subarrays.

<BR>&nbsp;
<TABLE BORDER>
<TR>
<TD><TT>&nbsp; 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
4&nbsp;&nbsp; 12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
8&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color='red'>10</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT></TD>
<TD><TT><B>37</B></TT></TD>
<TD><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;89</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;
68&nbsp;&nbsp; 45&nbsp;</TT></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

Now we will examine how to choose the pivot, and recurse into the left
partition of the array.

<p>
While finding the median element makes for the best case of QuickSort,
finding the median element takes more comparisons than is desirable.
Similarly, just choosing the first element will cause a sorted list to
take O(n<sup>2</sup>) comparisons to change nothing - merely verifying
the list is already sorted.

<p>
What we will do is take the median of three elements - the first, the
last and the middle (rounded to the front) element.  This is a
convenient merging of the ideals in keeping the QuickSort efficient.
Now we will descend into the left partition of the previous array:

<BR>&nbsp;
<TABLE BORDER>
<TR><TD>
 <TABLE BORDER><TR><TD><TT>&nbsp; <font
 color='blue'>2</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font
 color='blue'>4</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; 12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8&nbsp;&nbsp;
 <font color='blue'>10</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT></TD></TR></TABLE>
</TD><TD><TT><B>37</B></TT></TD>
<TD><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;89</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; 68&nbsp;&nbsp;
45&nbsp;</TT></TD></TR></TABLE>

The median of <font color='blue'>2</font>, <font color='blue'>4</font>,
and <font color='blue'>10</font> is <font color='blue'>4</font> so we
use <b>4</b> as our pivot.

<BR>&nbsp;
<TABLE BORDER>
<TR><TD>
 <TABLE BORDER><TR><TD><TT><b>4</b></TT></TD><TD><TT>&nbsp; <font
 color='red'>2</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font
 color='blue'>6</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 8&nbsp;&nbsp; 10&nbsp;&nbsp; </TT></TD></TR></TABLE>
</TD><TD><TT><B>37</B></TT></TD>
<TD><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;89</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; 68&nbsp;&nbsp;
45&nbsp;</TT></TD></TR></TABLE>

Comparing from the right, we find <font color='red'>2</font> as the
first element less than <b>4</b>.  From the left we find <font
color='blue'>6</font> as the first element less than <b>4</b>.  But
since our indices crossed, we know that the partitions are sorted, and
we are ready to place <b>4</b> in its sorted position, and recurse
again.

<BR>&nbsp;
<TABLE BORDER>
<TR><TD>
 <TABLE BORDER><TR><TD><TT> &nbsp; 2 &nbsp;
 </TT></TD><TD><TT><b>4</b></TT></TD><TD><TT>&nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</TD><TD><TT><B>37</B></TT></TD>
<TD><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;89</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; 68&nbsp;&nbsp;
45&nbsp;</TT></TD></TR></TABLE>

Recursing once again we find an array of one element, which is by
definition sorted.  Thus the recursion on this side is done.

<h3>QuickSort Pseudocode</h3>
For this MP, we shall choose the first element as our pivot. Thus, implementation will
require only one step. This is as follows, in pseudocode:

<!--
<div align='center'><table border><caption>Find Pivot</caption>
<tr><td>
<tt>middle</tt> = <tt>1</tt>+<tt>size</tt>/<tt>2</tt><br>
if Element(<tt>1</tt>) &gt; Element(<tt>size</tt>) then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swap (Element(<tt>1</tt>)), Element(<tt>size</tt>))<br>
End if<br>
if Element(<tt>middle</tt>) &gt; Element(<tt>size</tt>) then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swap (Element(<tt>middle</tt>), Element(<tt>size</tt>))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swap (Element(<tt>middle</tt>), Element(<tt>size</tt> - <tt>1</tt>))<br>
else if Element(<tt>size</tt>) &lt; Element(<tt>1</tt>) then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swap (Element(<tt>middle</tt>), Element(<tt>1</tt>))<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swap (Element(<tt>middle</tt>), Element(<tt>size</tt> - <tt>1</tt>))<br>
else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swap (Element(<tt>middle</tt>), Element(<tt>size</tt> - <tt>1</tt>))<br>
End if
</td></tr></table></div>
This algorithm accomplishes two things - it sorts the three elements it
compares, and places the pivot in the <tt>size</tt>-<tt>1</tt> location.
-->

<div align='center'><table border><caption>Partition(<tt>left</tt>,<tt>right</tt>)</caption>
<tr><td>
if <tt>left</tt> &lt <tt>right</tt> then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>front</tt> = <tt>left</tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>end</tt> = <tt>right</tt>+<tt>1</tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>pivot</tt> = value (<tt>left</tt>)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>front</tt> = <tt>front</tt> + <tt>1</tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while value (<tt>front</tt>) &lt; <tt>pivot</tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>end</tt> = <tt>end</tt> - <tt>1</tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while value (<tt>end</tt>) &gt; <tt>pivot</tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if <tt>front</tt> &lt; <tt>end</tt> then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SWAP (<tt>front</tt>, <tt>end</tt>)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end if<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while <tt>front</tt> &lt; <tt>end</tt><br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SWAP (<tt>left</tt>, <tt>end</tt>)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quicksort (<tt>left</tt>, <tt>end</tt>-<tt>1</tt>)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quicksort (<tt>end</tt>+<tt>1</tt>, <tt>right</tt>)<br>
end if
</td></tr></table></div>

This partitions the two halves, and recursively calls quicksort on each
half.  Note that they halves are not always even, and that a partition
of size one is by definition sorted.

<H1>Problem Description</H1>

<div align='center'><img src='screen-shot.jpg' alt='Pictorial: MP4 - Sorting Efficiency' width="651" height="331"></div>

<br>You must implement the two sorts described above.  This will allow you to verify for
yourself the efficiency differences between HeapSort and QuickSort.

<P>
The simple quicksort assumes the first element in the list as the pivot.  It's biggest downfall
is the case of an already sorted list.  This is acceptable for our purposes.  Rather than finding
the median of three as your pivot, just perform the comparisons and swaps as described above, but
with the pivot in the first position.  When it completes, swap the pivot with the last of the elements
less than or equal to it.  Then recurse.

<H2>The Procedures</H2>
You will implement the following procedures:
<H3>
TakeInput</H3>

<UL><B>Inputs:</B> none
<BR><B>Outputs:</B> input string written to <tt>Input</tt>, with '$' after last
<UL><LI>CF = 1 if ESC was pressed</LI></UL>
input character
<BR><B>Purpose:</B>
<BR>Handle user input with calls to KBDIN and DSPOUT.  Make sure you
handle the following:
<UL>
<LI>Backspacing, but only to the beginning of the line.
<LI>Don't overfill the buffer, but make sure to allow Backspacing.
<LI><tt>INPUT_SIZE</tt> holds the size of the buffer.</UL>
Return when either ESC or RETURN is pressed.
</UL>


<H3>
GetArray</H3>

<UL><B>Inputs:</b> input string
<UL><LI>BX = offset of first letter (in <tt>Input</tt>) to be part of the array)</UL>
<B>Outputs: </B>
<ul><li>unsorted array in <tt>list</tt>
<li><tt>list_size</tt> set to the number of elements
<li>comparison, swap counters zeroed</ul>
<B>Purpose:</B>
<BR>Copies the user-input characters into <tt>list</tt> starting from index <tt>1</tt> and sets
<tt>list_size</tt> accordingly.  Ignore all spaces.  The string ends with '$'.
</UL>

<H3>
Percolate</H3>

<UL><B>Inputs: </B>unsorted array, list_size
<UL><LI>[BP+4] = index of the root of the Heap (assuming a push BP like in the lecture notes)
    <LI>[BP+6] = Size of Heap. (assuming a push BP like in the lecture notes)
</UL>
<B>Outputs:</B> heapified array, number of swaps and comparisons
<BR><B>Purpose:</B>
<BR>Performs a percolate down, used both to form a heap, and reheapify
the heap after each element is pulled off.
following the guidelines illustrated in the pseudocode above.
<BR><B>Hints:</B> Children of n are at (2n) and (2n+1)
</UL>

<H3>
SortHeap</H3>

<UL><B>Inputs: </B>heap array, list_size
<BR><B>Outputs: </B>sorted array, number of swaps and comparisons
<BR><B>Purpose:</B>
<BR>
First, iterate backwards through your array to perform a BuildHeap operation.
Then iterate through the heap, removing the largest element and placing
at the end of the array, as in the pseudocode above.  This results in a
sorted list.  Then call Percolate to fix your heap.
</UL>

<H3>
QuickSort</H3>

<UL><B>Inputs:</B> unsorted array, size
<UL><LI>[BP+4] = index of left side of partition (assuming a push BP like in the lecture notes)
    <LI>[BP+6] = index of right side of partition (assuming a push BP like in the lecture notes)
</UL>
<B>Outputs:</B> sorted array, number of swaps and comparisons
<BR><B>Purpose:</B>
<BR>Use the first element as a pivot and perform a quicksort iteration,
recursively calling QuickSort unless the partition is verified as sorted.
Use the method in main for calling QuickSort recursively.  When your left index is above or equal
to your right index, QuickSort is done.
<BR><B>Hints:</B> SI and DI are your friends.
</UL>

<H3>
PrintList</H3>
<UL><B>Inputs:</B> <tt>dbug</tt>, <tt>list</tt> and <tt>list_size</tt>
<BR><B>Outputs:</B> Space separated printout of list values
<BR><B>Purpose:</B>
<BR>
Provide user feedback by showing the current state of the list if
<tt>dbug</tt> is non-zero.  Wait for user input if <tt>dbug</tt> = 2.
Called from Swap Macro.
</UL>

<H3>
Hints &amp; Observations</H3>
<UL>
<LI>
Remember when performing SortHeap that the size of the heap shrinks by
one, every iteration.  Correspondingly, the largest remaining element is
placed one position earlier every iteration.

<LI>
Use shifts instead of MUL and DIV when appropriate.

<LI>
The array is being indexed starting with one.  This means we are wasting an array location at
the beginning and the heap has children of Node n at Nodes (2n) and (2n+1)..  Don't forget this
 if you are using any library functions.
</UL>

<H3>
<B>Macros</B></H3>

<UL><B>Purpose:</B>
<BR>Macros lead to more understandable and often more efficient code.
<BR>Use macros for the following operations:
<BR>
<UL>
<LI><B>Compare:</B>
<UL><LI>Increment Comparison count variable
    <LI>If printing debugging information, output "Comparing <i>a b</i>"
    <LI>Return comparison flags</UL>
<LI><B>Swap:</B>
<UL><LI>Increment Swap count variable
    <LI>If printing debugging information, output "Swapping <i>a b</i>, and call PrintList"
    <LI>Swap the actual locations
    <LI>Note: you have to make sure that your macro will handle any way
    that it is called.  As you control these, it shouldn't be a problem.</UL>
</UL></UL>


<H2>Scoring</H2>



<UL>Points will be awarded for completion of each of these subroutines.
Your subroutines must perform all the functions of the library routines,
and must be interchangeable with them in order to receive full credit.
Macros must be used, but are not explicitly given a point value.
The point values for each subroutine are listed below:

</UL>

<H2>Gold Star</H2>

<UL>You can earn a gold star for programming excellence on this MP!  It's
not worth any additional points, but it's a chance to show off your programming
skills to the TAs.  To earn a gold star, you need to implement the Introsort
algorithm as described by David R. Musser in his paper <A href="http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~musser/gp/index_1.html">
Introspective Sorting and Selection Algorithms</A>.
<P>Introsort is similar to Quicksort:
it has an equally simple inner loop, and is as fast as quicksort for almost all input sequences;
it is never more than a few percent slower. Introsort, however, has the property that its
complexity is always O(N log N). Unlike quicksort, introsort is suitable for applications
where it is important to have a guaranteed upper bound on complexity.
<P>
We're very much looking forward to seeing your implementation!
