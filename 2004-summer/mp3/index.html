<H2>Introduction</H2>
<p align="left">In this MP, you'll be writing the video game that started it all -&nbsp; 
good ol' Pong.&nbsp; You'll be processing hardware interrupts to perform 
asynchronous I/O, drawing in text mode video, and even doing a little artificial 
intelligence to move the computer player's paddle.</p>

<H2>Problem Description</H2>
<h3>Program Variables</h3>
<p align="left">The <i>MPFlags</i> variable contains the status flags that are 
used in the MP.&nbsp; It is a waste of space to create separate variables for 
each of the status flags; the values of the flags will always be either 0 or 1, 
so we can use a bit to represent the flag instead of a byte.&nbsp; The following 
bullets describe how each bit in <i>MPFlags</i> is used.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bit 0 - Direction to move the user's paddle (0=up, 1=down)</li>
  <li>Bit 1 - Indicates the user wants to move his or her paddle (set when the
    user presses the UP or DOWN arrow key)</li>
  <li>Bit 2 - Exit Game (set when the user presses the ESC key)</li>
</ul>
<p>In using these flags, you should familiarize yourself with the logical instructions so that you're 
able to set, clear, or toggle one or more bits of a byte.</p>
<p>We need to keep multiple pieces of info for each of the NUMBALLS balls in the
game, namely position on the screen, direction of travel, and visibility.&nbsp;
To make things easier for you, a <i>Ball</i> structure has been defined as
follows:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">STRUC Ball<br>
.X&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resb	1<br>
.Y&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resb	1<br>
.Flags	resb	1<br>
ENDSTRUC</font></p>
<p>Where Ball.X holds the X coordinate, Ball.Y holds the Y coordinate, and
Ball.Flags is a flags variable which holds direction and visibility information
as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bit 0 - Visibility flag (0=not visible, 1=visible)</li>
  <li>Bit 1 - Horizontal direction flag (0=left, 1=right)</li>
  <li>Bit 2 - Vertical direction flag (0=up, 1=down)</li>
</ul>
<p>This structure definition creates the following constants:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">	Ball.X&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EQU	0<br>
	Ball.Y&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EQU	1<br>
	Ball.Flags	EQU	2<br>
	Ball_size&nbsp; EQU	3</font></p>
<p>The constants correspond to offsets of where the information will be
stored.&nbsp; So, the first thing stored in the Ball structure will be the X
coordinate, so Ball.X is offset 0 from the beginning of the structure.&nbsp;
Since we're reserving a byte for the X coordindate, Ball.Y, the next value to be
stored, will be at offset 1.&nbsp; Ball.Flags is at offset 2 for similar
reasons.&nbsp; Ball_size is also defined as the number of bytes taken up by the
structure, so in our case, Ball_size = 3.&nbsp; If we used words to hold the X
and Y coordinates, for instance, the constants would change as follows:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">	Ball.X&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EQU	0<br>
	Ball.Y&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;		EQU 2<br>
	Ball.Flags	EQU 4<br>
	Ball_size&nbsp;	EQU 5</font></p>
<p>For some reason, though, NASM doesn't like the use of structures with 16-bit
programs, so I had to define the constants as well as the structure for
you.&nbsp; In 32-bit programs, you only have to declare the structure, and NASM
will take care of defining the constants.</p>
<p>In order to actually reserve space in memory for the balls, we use a
declaration such as:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">Balls		times NUMBALLS*Ball_size db 0</font></p>
<p>We need to reserve a Ball structure for each ball we want in the game, so the
expression NUMBALLS*Ball_size corresponds to the number of bytes required to
hold NUMBALLS Ball structures.&nbsp; The declaration above creates <i>Balls</i>
as an array of <i>Ball</i> structures.</p>
<p>In order to use the structure to read/write parts of the <i>Balls </i>array,
you could use instructions such as:</p>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">mov&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; al, [Balls+Ball.X]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
; Reads the X coordinate of the first ball and stores it to al<br>
mov&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bx+Ball.Y], ah&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;
Writes ah to the Y coordinate of the Balls array element pointed to by bx</font></p>
<p>As you can see, the use of structures makes your code much more readable, as
it is easier to equate Ball.Y with the offset of the Y coordinate than it is to
equate 1 with the offset.</p>
<h3>Text Mode Video</h3>
<p>Section 11.1 of the lab manual discusses text mode video.&nbsp; In this MP, 
you'll be writing directly to page 0 of video memory, which we'll keep at the
standard size of 25 rows and 80 columns.&nbsp; The lab manual has examples on 
how to do this.&nbsp; Recall that page 0 of
video memory begins at segment:offset B800:0000h.&nbsp; &nbsp; Also, the colors you'll be working with in the MP are defined
for you as constants.</p>
<p>Double buffering is a technique used to eliminate screen flicker.&nbsp; If you've ever
played any old-school Nintendo games, you most likely seen the screen flicker
occasionally.&nbsp; With double buffering, you create a buffer equal to the size
of the video memory screen buffer (we'll call this buffer <i>ScreenBuffer</i>), draw the next frame to the temporary buffer,
then copy the entire temporary buffer to video memory when you're ready to
update the screen.&nbsp; This process allows for smooth transitions between 
frames, which solves the flicker problem.</p>
<h3>Asynchronous Keyboard I/O</h3>
<p>In previous MPs, we used the library's kbdin/kbdine functions to get
keyboard input. These functions continuously polled the keyboard until they received
input. In many cases, we want our programs to accept input from other devices
and/or execute other functions while waiting for user input. This is done by
writing our own interrupt service routines (ISRs). For this MP, we will be
obtaining user input from the keyboard asynchronously.  We'll also be using the system timer to  calculate 
when the balls and the paddles are able to move and to keep track of the running
time of the program.</p>
<h3>System Timer</h3>
<p>We'll be using the system timer interrupt in this MP to keep track of when
the balls and paddles are allowed to move.&nbsp; We'll also keep track of the
running time of the program in seconds.&nbsp; The default setup of the system
timer causes it to trigger an interrupt 18.2 times per second.&nbsp; Thus, well
increment a variable which is keeping track of the number of timer ticks, or
number of times the interrupt is called.&nbsp; Then, when this variable reaches
18, we'll reset it back to 0 and increment the number of seconds.</p>
<h3>String Instructions</h3>
<p>For certain parts of the MP, you can use the string instructions to improve 
the performance of your code.&nbsp; Like instructions that we've discussed 
already, the string instructions combine the functionality of multiple 
instructions into a single instruction.&nbsp; The string instructions are used 
to do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Move a string from one location to another (MOVSB, MOVSW, MOVSD)</li>
  <li>Store a single piece of data to a string (STOSB, STOSW, STOSD)</li>
  <li>Compare strings (CMPSB, CMPSW, CMPSD)</li>
  <li>Scan a string for a specific value (SCASB, SCASW, SCASD)</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">For specific details and usage of these instructions, refer to 
Appendix B.4 of the <a href="/ece291/books/labmanual">lab manual</a>.&nbsp; With 
each of the above instructions, you can also use the REP instruction with the CX 
register, which repeats the execution of the instruction CX times.</p>
<H2>MP3 Program Assignment</H2>
<P>You will replace these 
	procedures from the LIBMP3 library by commenting out the statements calling the 
	library procedure and adding your code. Each procedure that you write should 
	match the output of the library code exactly. Each of the function calls and 
	their functionality is described below in the <b>Subroutines</b> section. The 
	best way to get a feel for the program is to run it to see how it is supposed 
	to operate. You can also edit the test file to see how various changes will 
	affect the program execution.&nbsp; The program can be run by typing <TT>mp3</TT> 
at the command prompt.</P>

<H2>Subroutines</H2>
<P>This assignment has 15 subroutines. You will receive credit by replacing each 
	of these 15 subroutines listed below with your own code.

<h2>Development Log and Cover Memo</h2>
<p>As you work on the MP, you will keep a simple MP development log. The log
will document your design decisions, development plan, and debugging
experiences, including the time you spent on different parts of the machine
problem. The log may be kept in any form. In general, whenever you work on a
machine problem, briefly record the starting time, significant design decisions,
progress in coding and testing, bugs you discovered, and the ending time. Do <i>not</i>
record simple syntax errors detected by NASM at assembly time; these are not
considered to be bugs.</p>
<p>Then, you will submit a cover memo of 200 to 400 words (up to one page,
single spaced). The cover memo should answer the following questions, based on
the information that you record in your MP development log.</p>
<ul>
  <li>How much time did you spend on the design, coding, and testing of each
    part or subroutine?
  <li>What kinds of defects (bugs) did you find during the development of the
    program? When did you discover these defects (during code review or during
    testing)? How did you find them?
  <li>What you would do differently for the next MP?</li>
</ul>
<p>Type your cover memo into a plain text file in your MP3 directory.</p>

<H2>Hints</H2>
<UL>
	<LI>
		<P>
		The LIBMP3 file contains executable library functions for each of the routines 
		that you need to implement. This allows you to run the program and understand 
		how it works before you implement it. You can test your program with any 
		combinations of your own code and library functions. You will only receive 
		credit, however, for the routines that you implement yourself.
		</P>
	<LI>
		<P>
		When debugging your code in TD, you will find it helpful to use the memory 
		window to show you the memory location of the file and strings. You can also 
		use the watch window to keep track of variables in your code.
		</P>
	<LI>
		<P>
		Do not assume that the file starts at memory location 0.
		</P>
	<LI>
		<P>
		You may define new variables as needed.
		</P>
	<LI>
		<P>
		Be very careful if you call another procedure not to destroy registers that the 
		calling procedure uses.
		</P>
	<LI>
		<P><b>START EARLY!</b>
		</P>
	<LI>
		<P>You need to preserve <STRONG> </STRONG>register values in all of the procedures 
			you write.&nbsp; To do this, push all the registers you use in the procedure at 
			the beginning of the procedure.&nbsp; Then, pop them all in reverse order at 
			the end of the procedure (right before you return).
		</P>
	<LI>
		<P>You need to create function headers for each of the functions you write.&nbsp; 
			Function headers should include the name of the function, the list of inputs to 
			the function, the list of the outputs, and any functions that the function 
			calls.&nbsp; You will lose points if you do not do this.

<H2>Procedure</H2>
<UL>
	<LI>
		You will begin this MP with the following files:
		<UL>
			<LI>
				<TT>MP3.ASM</TT>: Program Framework
			<LI>
				<TT>Makefile</TT>: Specifies how and when programs are assembled and 
			linked.
			<LI>
				<TT>LIBMP3.LIB</TT>: Library functions for MP3
			<LI>
				<TT>LIB291.LIB</TT>: General-purpose library functions
			</LI>
		</UL>
	<LI>
		You may copy these files from the network drive to your home directory with the 
		following command:
		<BR>
		<TT>xcopy /s V:\ece291\mp3 W:\mp3</TT><BR>
		or download the files from this server as <a href="mp3.zip">mp3.zip</a>
	<LI>
		Add your code to <TT>MP3.ASM</TT>.
	<LI>
		Assemble and link your program by typing<TT> make.</TT>&nbsp; This command 
	reads the Makefile then invokes NASM and TLINK to build an executable program.
	<LI>
		Use TD debugger to find and correct program errors.</LI>
</UL>
<H2>Final Steps</H2>
<OL>
	<LI>
	Demonstrate your MP3.EXE to a TA or to the instructor.&nbsp; The TA or 
	instructor will verify that your program produces the correct output.
	<LI>
	Be prepared to answer questions about any aspect of the operation of your 
	program. The TAs will not accept an MP if you cannot fully explain the 
	operation of your code and details of your implementation. Delayed MPs will be 
	subject to late penalties as described in the course syllabus (10%/day).
	<LI>
		The TA will handin your MP online.
