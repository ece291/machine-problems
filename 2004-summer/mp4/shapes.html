<h1>Drawing Shapes and Text</h1>
<p>You'll be drawing various shapes and text in this MP.</p>
<h2>Lines</h2>
<p>Lines will be drawn with a modified version of Bresenham's Line
Algorithm.&nbsp; Our version of the algorithm needs to draw lines in all eight
octants.&nbsp; The pseudocode for our DrawLine algorithm is as follows:</p>
<pre>Variables:
x              = current x position on line
y              = current y position on line
dx             = number of pixels in x-direction
dy             = number of pixels in y-direction
lineerror      = error at each point of the algorithm
numpixels      = number of pixels to draw
xdiaginc       = the amount to add to x when lineerror &lt; 0
xhorizinc      = the amount to add to x when lineerror &gt;= 0
yvertinc       = the amount to add to y when lineerror &lt; 0 
ydiaginc       = the amount to add to y when lineerror &gt;= 0; 
errornodiaginc = the amount to add to lineerror when lineerror  &lt; 0
errordiaginc   = the amount to add to lineerror when lineerror &gt;= 0</pre>
<pre>procedure DrawLine(x1, y1, x2, y2, color)
begin 
 dx = abs(x2 - x1); 
 dy = abs(y2 - y1); 

 if dx &gt;= dy then 
  begin 
   numpixels = dx + 1; 
   lineerror = (2 * dy) - dx; 
   errornodiaginc = 2 * dy; 
   errordiaginc = 2 * (dy - dx); 
   xhorizinc = 1; 
   xdiaginc = 1; 
   yvertinc = 0; 
   ydiaginc = 1; 
  end 
 else 
  begin 
   numpixels = dy + 1;
   lineerror = (2 * dx) - dy;
   errornodiaginc = 2 * dx;
   errordiagdinc = 2 * (dx - dy);
   xhorizinc = 0;
   xdiaginc = 1;
   yvertinc = 1;
   ydiaginc = 1;
  end</pre>
<pre> if x1 &gt; x2 then 
  begin 
   xhorizinc = -xhorizinc;
   xdiaginc  = -xdiaginc;
  end
 if y1 &gt; y2 then
  begin
   yvertinc = -yvertinc;
   ydiaginc = -ydiaginc;
  end</pre>
<pre> x := x1;
 y := y1; 
 for i := 1 to numpixels do 
  begin 
   DrawPixel(x, y, color);
   if lineerror &lt; 0 then
    begin 
     lineerror += errornodiaginc;
     x += xhorizinc;
     y += yvertinc;
    end
   else
     lineerror += errordiaginc;
     x += xdiaginc;
     y += ydiaginc;
    end
   end
 end</pre>
<h2>Rectangles</h2>
<p>Drawing rectangles is much easier now that you can draw lines, as a rectangle
is made up of&nbsp; four of them.&nbsp; I don't think you need pseudocode for
this one.</p>
<h2>Circles</h2>
<p>Bresenham didn't stop at a line algorithm - he also made one to draw
circles.&nbsp; You will be using this algorithm to draw your circles.&nbsp; The
DrawCircle pseudocode is as follows:</p>
<p><tt>procedure DrawCircle(int x, int y, int r)<br>
begin<br>
&nbsp;int xdist = 0;<br>
&nbsp;int ydist = r;<br>
&nbsp;int circleerror = 1 - r;<br>
&nbsp;while (xdist &lt;= ydist) do<br>
&nbsp; begin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; DrawPixel(x + xdist, y + ydist);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; DrawPixel(x - xdist, y + ydist);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; DrawPixel(x + xdist, y - ydist);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; DrawPixel(x - xdist, y - ydist);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; DrawPixel(x + ydist, y + xdist);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; DrawPixel(x - ydist, y + xdist);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; DrawPixel(x + ydist, y - xdist);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; DrawPixel(x - ydist, y - xdist);</tt></p>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; xdist++;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; if (circleerror &lt; 0) then </tt><tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; circleerror += 2 * xdist + 1;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; begin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ydist--;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; circleerror += 2 * (xdist - ydist) + 1;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end<br>
&nbsp; end<br>
end</tt></p>
<h2>Text - Blitting Revisited</h2>
<p>Here's the image of a section of the font file, with the 'A' being the
character we will draw to the screen.&nbsp; The entire font file has 128
characters, and each character is 16 pixels wide and 16 pixels high.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="font-a.png" width="185" height="50"></p>
<p>The offset of the upper-left corner of a character in the font image is
dependent on the character's ASCII value, the size of the character, and the
number of bytes needed for each pixel.&nbsp; Take the letter 'A' in this
example. Its offset in the font image is 4160 decimal, and here's how to get
that number:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ASCII value of 'A' is 65 decimal</li>
  <li>Each letter in the font image is 16 pixels wide</li>
  <li>Each pixel is represented by 4 bytes in memory</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, 65 * 16 pixels * 4 bytes / pixel = 4160 bytes.&nbsp; Using this initial
offset and the information above about each character and the font file, copy
the character out of the font and onto the screen buffer.&nbsp; Do this for
every character in the string, and voilà, you have a string of text on the
screen.</p>
