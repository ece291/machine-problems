<H1>Drawing anti-aliased text with alpha blitting</H1>
<p>Anti-aliasing is a technique in computer graphics of eliminating the &quot;jaggies&quot;
of an image (yes that's a technical term, really) to make it look smoother.&nbsp;
To get an anti-aliased string showing up on the screen, you will need to copy
each character of the string out of a source location (font image) into a
destination location (screen buffer).&nbsp; For each pixel you copy out of the
source, you will need to calculate its alpha opacity before writing it to the
destination.</p>
<p>There are two parts to the idea of alpha blitting - the alpha part and the
blitting part (ingenious, huh?).&nbsp; We've already dealt with <a href="hiresgraph.html">blitting</a>
a general section of a source image, so now let's apply this to drawing
text.&nbsp; We'll get to the alpha stuff after that.</p>
<h1>Blitting Revisited</h1>
<p>Again, here's the image of a section of the font file, with the 'A' being the
character we will draw to the screen.&nbsp; The entire font file has 128
characters, and each character is 16 pixels wide and 16 pixels high.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align=center><img border="0" src="font-a.png" width="185" height="50"></p>
<p>The offset of the upper-left corner of a character in the font image is
dependent on the character's ASCII value, the size of the character, and the
number of bytes needed for each pixel.&nbsp; Take the letter 'A' in this
example. Its offset in the font image is 4160 decimal, and here's how to get
that number:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ASCII value of 'A' is 65 decimal</li>
  <li>Each letter in the font image is 16 pixels wide</li>
  <li>Each pixel is represented by 4 bytes
    in memory</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, 65 * 16 pixels * 4 bytes / pixel = 4160 bytes.&nbsp; Using this initial
offset and the information above about each character and the font file, copy
the character out of the font and into the screen buffer.&nbsp; Do this for
every character in the string, and voil&agrave;, you have a string of text on
the screen.</p>
<h1>Alpha Opacity</h1>
<p>A lot of people think of transparency when they hear the word
&quot;alpha&quot; in the context of graphics. They're right, sorta. Al<img alt="Figure A: Outlined Coverage of a Triangle on a pixel grid" src="triangle.png" align="right" width="360" height="270">pha
really refers to the opacity of a pixel, which is derived generally from the
coverage of a pixel.</p>
<p align="left">What is meant by the coverage of a pixel? Let's say you're
drawing a triangle. The bottom and the left of the triangle are horizontal and
vertical, respectively. The remaining side is at 45°. Now fill this triangle
with a blue color. Now draw it to the screen. The outline, zoomed in, is shown
in Figure A.</p>
<p align="left">Where are the 45° pixels? For that matter, if all these lines
go through the centers of pixels, chances are the left and bottom and
upper-right include a lot of half-covered pixels; the lower-left corner has a
one-quarter covered pixel and the two remaining corners have about a one-eighth
covered pixel, as visualized in Figure A.<br>
</p>
<h2 align="left"><br>
<b>The Over Operation</b></h2>
<p>So how do you turn this into actual pixels? The simplest way, and the way
we're using, is called the over operation. To draw color A with coverage &#945;
over color B, the resulting color C is calculated as follows:</p>
<p>C<sub>r</sub> = (&#945;<sub>r</sub> * A<sub>r</sub>) + ((1-&#945;<sub>r</sub>)
* B<sub>r</sub>)<br>
C<sub>g</sub> = (&#945;<sub>g</sub> * A<sub>g</sub>) + ((1-&#945;<sub>g</sub>) *
B<sub>g</sub>)<br>
C<sub>b</sub> = (&#945;<sub>b</sub> * A<sub>b</sub>) + ((1-&#945;<sub>b</sub>) *
B<sub>b</sub>)</p>
<p>Or more succinctly, as we only have one &#945;, apply this to each channel
independently:<img alt="Figure B: Triangle Drawn with Over Compositions, alpha by coverage" src="triangle-over.png" align="right" width="360" height="270">
<p align="left">C = (&#945; * A) + ((1-&#945;) * B)</p>
<p>When we apply this to the case as listed above, with coverage values one,
one-half, one-quarter, and one-eighth, we get something that looks like Figure
B, only not quite so zoomed in, and no grid.<br>
<br>
Things like this are where alpha opacity values originally come from. Don't
worry about how to calculate the alpha value, as the font image comes with an
alpha value for you. Concentrate on how to apply it using the over operator.</p>
<p>Here's how the value for the lower-left corner pixel was calculated, assuming
a white background (B) upon which you draw a pure blue pixel with 25% coverage:</p>
<div class="eqn">
  C = (&#945; * A) + ((1-&#945;) * B)<br>
  C = (0.25 * {0.0, 0.0, 1.0}) + (0.75 * {1.0, 1.0, 1.0})<br>
  C = {0.0, 0.0, 0.25} + {0.75, 0.75, 0.75}<br>
  C = {0.75, 0.75, 1.0}
</div>
<p>As you can see, the math is simple. In our case, we can simplify it even
further.&nbsp; Our background color will <b>always</b> be black, which is
represented as {0.0,0.0,0.0}.&nbsp; So, taking the general equation on a black
background will yield:</p>
<p>C = (&#945; * A) + ((1-&#945;) * B)<br>
C = (&#945; * A) + ((1-&#945;) * {0.0, 0.0, 0.0})<br>
C = (&#945; * A) + {0.0, 0.0, 0.0}<br>
C = (&#945; * A)</p>
<p>
Notice that the pixels in the font file are all black, with some of them being darker than
others.&nbsp; The lighter pixels are the anti-aliased ones, and they have alpha values
closer to zero that distinguish them as such (<tt>0h</tt> is no coverage, while <tt>FFh</tt> is
total coverage).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wait... all the pixels are black?&nbsp; How will we be able to see the
characters on a black background? Can we get text of different color? Yes you
can.&nbsp; To do this, the easiest way is to set them manually by OR'ing the
pixel's RGB portion with a hex color value, making sure not to change the alpha
portion.&nbsp; So if you OR'ed a pixel with <tt>007F7F7Fh</tt>, you'd set its
color to gray. </p>
<p>We now introduce an optimized algorithm that uses MMX instructions to alpha
compose all four channels of a pixel at once:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Load one source pixel (4 bytes) into an MMX register (8 bytes) - yes this
    can be done, take a look at the MMX manual</li>
  <li>Unpack (bytes to words) the source pixel into an MMX register</li>
  <li>Copy out the source alpha byte into the four words of another MMX register</li>
  <li>Multiply the two previously mentioned MMX registers together, as this will
    perform C = (&#945; * A)</li>
  <li>Shift each word right to divide by 256, thus fitting into a byte per
    channel</li>
  <li>Pack (words to bytes) the alpha-composed pixel back together with proper
    saturation</li>
  <li>Store the pixel into a general purpose register from the MMX register -
    again this can be done</li>
</ul>
