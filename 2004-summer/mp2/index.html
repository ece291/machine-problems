<h2>Problem Description</h2>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="mp2.jpg" width="669" height="494"></p>

<p>Your program will be:
<ul>
<li>Obtaining user input and storing the input in a 
buffer<li>Parsing the string of numbers into an array 
<li>Sorting the array with two different&nbsp; 
and analyzing their performance</ul>



<h2>Obtaining User Input</h2>
<p>User input will be obtained from the keyboard.&nbsp; As the user types a 
string of numbers, you should store the string to a buffer.&nbsp; Your program 
should also allow the user to use the backspace key if he or she mistypes a 
character in the string.&nbsp; In this situation, the cursor should be moved to 
the previous location on the screen, and the last character in the buffer should 
be allowed to be overwritten by a new value.</p>

<h2>Parsing User Input</h2>
<p>Once you've written the input string to the buffer, you need to parse it into an
array of numbers.&nbsp; This is much easier as it seems, thanks to the library ascbin function.&nbsp; Take a look at the lab manual to see how it works - it
will save you a great deal of time.&nbsp; You should traverse the entire input string, pulling out one number at a time, converting it from ascii to
binary, and  storing the number into the array whose pointer is passed in to
the ParseInput function.&nbsp; Keep track of how many numbers you parse.&nbsp;
Remember that the input string is '$' terminated, so stop when you reach a
'$'.&nbsp; The array can hold up to 25 numbers, so if there are more numbers in
the input string than 25, you should not add the extra ones to the array.&nbsp;
If ascbin returns an error code (dl is nonzero), the ParseInput function should
return -1 to indicate there was an error in parsing the input; otherwise, you
should return the length of the array (how many numbers you successfully
parsed).</p>



<h2><a href="sorting.html">Sorting Algorithms</a></h2>

<h2>Development Log and Cover Memo</h2>
<p>As you work on the MP, you will keep a simple MP development 
log. The log will document your design decisions, development plan, and 
debugging experiences, including the time you spent on different parts of the 
machine problem. The log may be kept in any form. In general, whenever you work 
on a machine problem, briefly record the starting time, significant design 
decisions, progress in coding and testing, bugs you discovered, and the ending 
time. Do <i>not</i> record simple syntax errors detected by NASM at assembly 
time; these are not considered to be bugs.</p>
<p>Then, you will submit a cover memo of 200 to 400 words (up to one page, 
single spaced). The cover memo should answer the following questions, based on 
the information that you record in your MP development log. </p>
<ul>
  <li>How much time did you spend on the design, coding, and testing of each 
  part or subroutine? </li>
  <li>What kinds of defects (bugs) did you find during the development of the 
  program? When did you discover these defects (during code review or during 
  testing)? How did you find them? </li>
  <li>What you would do differently for the next MP? </li>
</ul>
<p>Type your cover memo into a plain text file in your MP2 directory.</p>

<h2>Hints</h2>
<ul>
<li>The LIBMP2 file contains executable library functions for each of the
routines that you need to implement.  
This allows you to run the program and understand how it works before you implement it.  You can test your program with any combinations of your own
code and library functions.  You will only receive credit, however, for
the routines that you implement yourself.</li><p>

<li>When debugging your code in TD, you will find it helpful to use
the memory window to show you the memory location of the file and strings.
You can also use the watch window to keep track of variables in your code.</li><p>

<li>Do not assume that the file starts at memory location 0.</li><p>

<li>You may define new variables as needed.</li><p>

<li>Be very careful if you call another procedure not to destroy registers
that the calling procedure uses.</li><p>

<li>You need to preserve register values in all of the procedures you
  write.&nbsp; To do this, push all the registers you use in the procedure at
  the beginning of the procedure.&nbsp; Then, pop them all in reverse order at
  the end of the procedure (right before you ret).</li><p>

<li>You need to create function headers for each of the functions you
  write.&nbsp; Function headers should include the name of the function, the
  list of inputs to the function, the list of the outputs, and any functions
  that the function calls.&nbsp; You will lose points if you do not do this!</li><p>

<li>START EARLY!</li><p>


<li>Monitor the <a href="http://my.ece.uiuc.edu/webboard/select.asp?bid={38D8D827-70BA-4FB6-A186-3C9AD02FC672}">
webboard</a> for clarifications and help.<p>

</ul>

<h2>Procedures</h2>

<p>This assignment has six procedures. You will receive credit by replacing
each of these six procedures listed below with your own code. </p>


<p>Each of the procedures you will write in this MP is C-style.&nbsp; Thus, the 
inputs to the procedures (if any) are passed on the
stack.&nbsp; Inputs with asterisks (*) indicate pointers, and inputs without 
asterisks indicate actual values.&nbsp; If the procedure returns a value, the value will be returned in AL 
or AX.&nbsp; Also, the general purpose registers other than SI and DI may be
overwritten (you do not have to preserve their values). </p>


<p>The size of the inputs, as well as the size of the return value, are included
in each procedure definition.&nbsp; If a procedure does not have any inputs, <b>void</b>
will be present in the parentheses.&nbsp; Similarly, if the function does not
return a value, it will be declared as <b>void</b> before the name of the
function. </p>


<h3>word<b> GetInput(word *BufferPtr)</b></h3>


<ul>
<li>Obtains input from the user and stores to buffer in memory</li>
<li>Inputs:
  <ul>
    <li>BufferPtr - Pointer to buffer in memory</li>
  </ul>
<li>Outputs:&nbsp; Buffer filled with&nbsp;input data</li>
<li>Returns: Non-zero if the user presses ESC to exit the program, 0 otherwise</li>
<li>Calls: kbdin, dspout</li>
<li>Notes:
  <ul>
    <li>The buffer has a maximum size of 75 bytes - make sure that you do not exceed the buffer
      length</li>
    <li>Terminate the input loop when the user presses either the ESC key or the ENTER 
    key.&nbsp; Set the appropriate return value, and if the user pressed the 
    ENTER key, also add a '$' to the end of the buffer.</li>
    <li>You should correctly handle backspacing.&nbsp; If the user hits
      backspace, you the cursor should move back to the previous spot, and the
      character at that spot should be removed on the screen.&nbsp; The current
      position in the buffer must also be updated.&nbsp; If you are at the
      beginning of the buffer and a backspace key is received, you should not
      process it.</li>

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ul>
<li>You will begin this MP with the following files:
    <ul>
    <li><tt>MP2.ASM</tt>: Program Framework
    <li><tt>Makefile</tt>: Specifies how and when programs are assembled
        and linked.</li>
    <li><tt>LIBMP2.LIB</tt>: Library functions for MP2</li>
    <li><tt>LIB291.LIB</tt>: General-purpose library functions</li>
    </ul>
<li>You may copy these files from the network drive to your home directory
    with the following command: <br>
    <tt>xcopy /s V:\ece291\mp2 W:\mp2</tt><br>
    or download the files from this server as <a href="mp2.zip">mp2.zip</a> 
</li>
<li>Add your code to <tt>MP2.ASM</tt>.
<li>Assemble and link your program by typing<tt> make.</tt>&nbsp; This command reads
  the Makefile then invokes NASM and TLINK to build 
    an executable program.  
<li>Use TD debugger to find and correct program errors.
</ul>

<h2>Final Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Demonstrate your MP2.EXE to a TA or to the instructor.&nbsp; The TA or
    instructor will verify that your program produces the correct output. </li>
  <li>Be prepared to answer questions about any aspect of the operation of
   your program. The TAs will not accept an MP if you cannot fully explain
   the operation of your code and details of your implementation. Delayed
   MPs will be subject to late penalties as described in the course
   syllabus (10pts/day).</li>
  <li>The TA will handin your MP online.
</ol>
