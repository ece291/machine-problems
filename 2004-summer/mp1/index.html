<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>Database systems play an integral part in the world of business.&nbsp; A simple example is the
gradebook database for ECE 291.  It stores the records of the students and their performance on homeworks, exams, and projects.
In this MP, you will be reading from a simple ECE 291 gradebook database to
calculate each student's total score, storing this score in the database, and
then displaying a histogram of the entire class to the screen, as shown below.
</p>

<h2>Problem Description</h2>

<p>Your program is required to:
<ul>
<li>Calculate the total score for each record 
<li>Sort the total into its corresponding range 
<li>Build a string of stars to represent the number of students whose scores
  fall into one of the defined ranges
<li>Display a histogram of the database distribution

</ul>



<p>This table depicts how each database record is stored in the data file.</p>

</TABLE>

<p> Each B in the table above represents a byte.&nbsp; So, there are six
homeworks, five MPs, two exams, and one project that will compose a student's
total score.&nbsp; There is a very good chance this value will be above 255, so
we need to store the total score as a word (W).&nbsp; Below is an example of one
of the entries in the database:</P>

<p>20,20,20,20,20,20,20,30,55,73,85,80, 59, 66,115,120,0,0<P>Notice that there are <b>two</b>
zeroes at the end since we need to reserve 2 bytes (1 word) for the total score.</P>
<P>You compute the total score based on the equations in the course syllabus:</P>

HWSUM = SUM(HW0+HW1+HW2+HW3+HW4+HW5+HW6)<br>
IF ( HWSUM &gt; 100 )<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; HWSUM = 100<br>
END IF<br>
TOTAL = HWSUM +
MP0 + MP1 + MP2 + MP3 + MP4 + EXAM1 + EXAM2 + FINAL + PROJECT<p>After you calculate the total, you will need to store the result in the
student's record in the database.</p>

<H2>MP1 Program Assignment</H2>

<p>The gradebook data is available in the <b>Grades </b>variable.&nbsp; Each
student's total score will be used to update the corresponding cell in the <b>RangeCount
</b>array into which it falls.&nbsp; Each string of
stars will be stored in the <b>StarString </b>variable.&nbsp; When displaying the histogram to the screen, you
need to display each of the strings in the <b>RangeStrings</b> variable with its
corresponding <b>StarString</b>.</p>

<p>In this machine problem, the main procedure is provided for you; however,
you must write the code to replace the library proecedures.
You will replace these procedures from the LIBMP1
library by commenting out the statements calling the library procedure and adding your code.  Each
procedure that you write
should match the output of the library code exactly.  Each of the function calls and their functionality is described below in the
<b>Procedures</b> section.
The best way to get a feel for the program is to run it
to see how it is supposed to operate.  You can also edit the test
file to see how various changes will affect the program execution.</p>



<p>The program can be run by typing <tt>mp1</tt> at the
command prompt.
</p>

<h2>Development Log and Cover Memo</h2>
<p>As you work on each machine problem, you will keep a simple MP development 
log. The log will document your design decisions, development plan, and 
debugging experiences, including the time you spent on different parts of the 
machine problem. The log may be kept in any form. In general, whenever you work 
on a machine problem, briefly record the starting time, significant design 
decisions, progress in coding and testing, bugs you discovered, and the ending 
time. Do <i>not</i> record simple syntax errors detected by NASM at assembly 
time; these are not considered to be bugs.</p>
<p>For each machine problem, beginning with MP1, you will submit a cover memo of 
200 to 400 words (up to one page, single spaced). The cover memo should answer 
the following questions, based on the information that you record in your MP 
development log. </p>
<ul>
  <li>How much time did you spend on the design, coding, and testing of each 
  part or subroutine? </li>
  <li>What kinds of defects (bugs) did you find during the development of the 
  program? When did you discover these defects (during code review or during 
  testing)? How did you find them? </li>
  <li>What you would do differently for the next MP? </li>
</ul>
<p>Type your cover memo into a plain text file in your MP1 directory.</p>

<h2>Hints</h2>
<ul>
<li>The LIBMP1 file contains executable library functions for each of the
routines that you need to implement.  
This allows you to run the program and understand how it works before you implement it.  You can test your program with any combinations of your own
code and library functions.  You will only receive credit, however, for
the routines that you implement yourself. <p>

<li>When debugging your code in TD, you will find it helpful to use
the memory window to show you the memory location of the file and strings.
You can also use the watch window to keep track of variables in your code.<p>

<li>Do not assume that the file starts at memory location 0.<p>

<li>You may define new variables as needed.<p>

<li>Be very careful if you call another procedure not to destroy registers
that the calling procedure uses.<li>START EARLY!  This is the first MP that requires you to write your
own program.  Composition is much more difficult than comprehension.
</ul>

<ul>
<li>You need to preserve register values in all of the procedures you
  write.&nbsp; To do this, push all the registers you use in the procedure at
  the beginning of the procedure.&nbsp; Then, pop them all in reverse order at
  the end of the procedure (right before you ret).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>You need to create function headers for each of the functions you
  write.&nbsp; Function headers should include the name of the function, the
  list of inputs to the function, the list of the outputs, and any functions
  that the function calls.&nbsp; You will lose points if you do not do this!</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Monitor the

<h2>Procedures</h2>

<p>This assignment has four procedures. You will receive credit by replacing
each of these four procedures listed below with your own code. </p>

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ul>
<li>You will begin this MP with the following files:
    <ul>
    <li><tt>MP1.ASM</tt>: Program Framework
    <li><tt>Makefile</tt>: Specifies how and when programs are assembled
        and linked.</li>
    <li><tt>LIBMP1.LIB</tt>: Library functions for MP1</li>
    <li><tt>LIB291.LIB</tt>: General-purpose library functions</li>
    </ul>
<li>You may copy these files from the network drive to your home directory
    with the following command: <br>
    <tt>xcopy /s V:\ece291\mp1 W:\mp1</tt><br>
    or download the files from this server as <a href="mp1.zip">mp1.zip</a> 
</li>
<li>Add your code to <tt>MP1.ASM</tt>.
<li>Assemble and link your program by typing<tt> make.</tt>&nbsp; This command reads
  the Makefile then invokes NASM and TLINK to build 
    an executable program.  
<li>Use TD debugger to find and correct program errors.
</ul>

<h2>Final Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Demonstrate your MP1.EXE to a TA or to the instructor.&nbsp; The TA or
    instructor will verify that your program produces the correct output. </li>
  <li>Be prepared to answer questions about any aspect of the operation of
   your program. The TAs will not accept an MP if you cannot fully explain
   the operation of your code and details of your implementation. Delayed
   MPs will be subject to late penalties as described in the course
   syllabus (10pts/day).</li>
  <li>The TA will handin your MP online.
</ol>
