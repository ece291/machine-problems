<h2>Introduction</h2>
For this machine problem, you are to write a program which produces
a frequency distribution table of ECE291 scores.  
The program converts a list of raw homework, MP, exam, and final
scores into a table that shows the frequencies of the total scores.
The output of your program will be similar to the score distribution
charts on the ECE291 gradebook page; except that your output will use
ASCII '*' symbols rather than red bars.  
Futher, your program will plot the number of scores in a 16-bit
range, rather than the 10-point range on the web page.
<p>
A list of scores is given to you in the form of a <i>database</i>.
For ECE291, our database is collection
of records that each hold a student ID and individual raw scores.  
The ID is an alpha-numeric string stored as 5 ASCII characters
and terminated with a '$' symbol.  Each of the 16 individual raw scores is
stored as a 1-byte unsigned integer.  The <i>total score</i> is
represented as a 2-byte unsigned integer.  In total, each ECE291 record
occupies 24 bytes.  
<p>
Sample databases are included with this assignment.  The real database
with your IDs and scores is available on-line from the gradebook page.

<h2>Record Format</h2>
The record format of the ECE291 database is
summarized below.  In this table 'A' represents an ASCII character;
'$' represents the ASCII character used to mark the end of a string;
'B' represents a 1-byte unsigned integer; and 'WW' represents a 2-byte
unsigned integer.  The <i>offset</i> refers to the starting 
location of each field in each 24-byte array.

<p>
For this machine problem, you will use the INCLUDE directive to read
a database of fictitious ECE291 scores into your program.  
This directive will insert the contents of the specified file 
into your .ASM program at the time you assemble with MASM.
The <tt>gbk-test.dta</tt> and <tt>gbk-big.dta</tt> files each
define a variable called <tt>gbk</tt> which holds 
an entire database of student records as well as a variable called 
<tt>numrec</tt> which stores the number of records in the database.  
The contents of <tt>gbk-test.dta</tt> is shown below:

A similar table of current scores for this class can be dynamically 
generated and downloaded from the ECE291 on-line gradebot.

<h2>Procedures</h2>
This assignment has three procedures.  You will receive credit for this
assignment by replacing each of three procedures listed below with your
own code.

<ul>
<li><font size=+1><b>CompTotal</b></font>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose</b>: Computes the total score (<tt>total</tt>)
      for each  student in the gradebook as the sum of HW, MP, exam, 
      and the final scores.
  <li><b>Input</b>: <tt>numrec</tt> variable and <tt>hw, mp, exam</tt>, and 
       <tt>final</tt> fields of <tt>gbk</tt> records.
  <li><b>Output</b>: <tt>total</tt> field of <tt>gbk</tt> records.
  <li><b>Note1</b>: Recall that the subtotal of the homework scores 
      needs to be divided by four.  
  <li><b>Note2</b>: Observe that you are adding byte-sized integers
      to compute a word-sized total.  
  <li><b>Hint1</b>: There is an efficient opcode that 
       divides an integer by a power of two.
  <li><b>Hint2</b>: Avoid repetitive code by using loops to iterate 
       though the records and compute sums.  
  <li><b>Points</b>: 16 
  </ul>
  <p>

<li><font size=+1><b>FillTable</b></font>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose</b>: Compute the score distribution array,
      (<tt>ScoreDist</tt>), as the frequency of students that 
      achieve a range of scores.  This routine should also compute 
        the lowest and highest score ranges.
  <li><b>Input</b>: <tt>total</tt> fields of the <tt>gbk</tt> array
  <li><b>Outputs</b>: <tt>ScoreDist</tt> array and
       <tt>MinBin</tt>, <tt>MaxBin</tt> variables.
  <li><b>Description</b>: Each element (or "bin") of the <tt>ScoreDist</tt> 
      array represents a 16-point range of total points.  The array has 
      been defined with 65 elements to represent all possible scores
      between 0 and 1030.  The first bin,
      (<tt>ScoreDist[0]</tt>), represents the number of students
      that have scores between 0 and 15.  The last bin 
      (<tt>ScoreDist[64]</tt>), represents the number of students
      that have scores between 1024 and 1039.  The variables
      <tt>MinBin</tt> and <tt>Maxbin</tt> represent the lowest and
      highest score range obtained by one or more students.
      <tt>MinBin</tt> represents the first non-empty bin and
      <tt>MaxBin</tt> represents the last non-empty bin.
  <li><b>Hint</b>: The <tt>ScoreDist</tt> array can be computed using
       only a single pass through the <tt>gbk</tt> array.
  <li><b>Points</b>: 17
  </ul><p>

<li><font size=+1><b>PlotChart</b></font>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose</b>: Plots the distibution chart using the ASCII
     asterisk (*) symbol to represent the number of students obtaining
     the same score range.
  <li><b>Inputs</b>: <tt>ScoreDist</tt> array and
       <tt>MinBin</tt>, <tt>MaxBin</tt> variables.
  <li><b>Output</b>: Prints to the screen 
  <li><b>Hint</b>: Use the BINASC, DSPMSG, and DSPOUT routines of LIB291.
      Be sure to note how registers are used and modified by each routine.
  <li><b>Points</b>: 17
  </ul>      
</ul>

<h2>Sample Output</h2>
<ul>
<li>For the sample database (<tt>gbk-test.dta</tt>, as shown above), 
the computed scores totals are: PRFCT=1000 (3E8h), DOPEY=472 (1D8h),
HAPPY=766 (2FEh), LUCKY=782 (30Eh), and ANGRY=472 (1D8h).  The expected
output of the program is shown below:

<li>You can test this case with your program by modifying 
     the INCLUDE statement in your variable section to:
      <tt>INCLUDE gbk-big.dta </tt>
<li>In general, Your output should match the output of the LIBMP1 routines 
     for any input.
</ul>

<h2>Preliminary Procedure</h2>
<ul>
<li>Copy the 
    empty MP1 program (<tt>MP1.ASM)</tt>), 
    example database files (<tt>gbk-test.dta</tt> and <tt>gbk-big.dta</tt>),
    sample output (<tt>gbk-test.out</tt> and <tt>gbk-big.out</tt>),
    libraries (<tt>libmp1.lib</tt> and <tt>lib291.lib</tt>), and 
    <tt>Makefile</tt> from the network drive to your home directory
    with the following command: <br>
    <tt>xcopy /s V:\ece291\mp1 W:\mp1</tt><br>
    Alternatively, from home you can download the same files as 
    <a href="mp1.zip">mp1.zip</a>.
<li>As with MP0, run <tt>NMake</tt> to build an executable program 
    using the given ECE291 library functions.
<li>As with MP0, use a text editor to modify the program.
    As given, the program uses LIBMP1 routines to implement all
    functionality.  To receive full credit for the assignment,
    you will need to implement each of the subroutines described above with
    your own code.
<li>As with MP0, use CodeView (<tt>CV</tt>) to debug and test your program.
    Because you only receive credit for procedures that function completely
    as specified, it is best to debug each routine individually.  
<li>By modifying a few comments, you can mix and match usage of your 
    own code and Library routines.  You may notice that the LIBMP1
    routines contain extraneous and difficult-to-read code.  They 
    are not meant to be easily unassembled!
</ul>


<h2>Final Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download and print the MP1 grading sheet from the web site.
<li>Verify that your program meets all requirements for handin.
<li>Demonstrate MP1.EXE to a TA or to the instructor.  
    You will
    then be asked to recompile and demonstrate 
    MP1 with different database files.
    Your program must work with all given input.
    Once approved, you are ready to turn in your program.
<li>Be prepared to answer questions about any aspect of the operation of your
    program.  The TAs will not accept an MP if you cannot fully
    explain the operation of your code.
<li>Print MP1.ASM 
<li>Electrically submit your programs to the TA's handin floppy: <br>
    <tt>A:\HANDIN </tt><i> MyWindowsLogin</i>
<li>Take your printout and disk with MP1 to the same TA which approved your 
    demonstration.  Be sure that your name is on the disk and on the printout.

        Prof. John W. Lockwood
        University of Illinois, Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering
        Spring 1999
        Revision 2.0

        This program produces a distribution table of ECE291 total
        scores using a table of raw scores for homeworks, machine problems,
        exams, and the final.
