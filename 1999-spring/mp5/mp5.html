<h2>Introduction</h2>
For MP5, we will complete the game of <i>Network Tag</i>
by adding the code to process multicast datagrams, read the
status of the mouse control, and implement the game control algorithms.
Our program allows up to 63 players to simultaneously
play a game of <i>Network Tag</i>.
<p>
A screen shot of an actual game is shown below:<br>
<img src="mp5-sample-screen.gif" width="650" height="460">
<p>
We each represent ourself in the game with our unique bitmapped image. 
When we enter the game, we transmit our 32x32, 16-color, BMP image
to everyone else in the game within a HELLO message.  
Upon receiving a HELLO message, other players
store our image into a local variable on their machine
called <i>ImageArray</i> and note that we
are active by updating a flag in the <i>Player</i> variable.
Once every two seconds, we retransmit our HELLO message to reach new players 
that may have just entered the game.
<p>
The position of the mouse will be used to 
determine the position of our image
on the screen.  Over the network, we will transmit our
position in an UPDATE message to
the other players in the game.  
<p>
We learn of the positions
of other players by listening to the network.  
We store information from other players in our local <i>Player</i>
variable.
Positions are specified as an offset on a mode-13 VGA screen.  
Our movements are limited to within
the perimeter of the 320x200-pixel screen.  
<p>
<h2>Program Operation</h2>
Before you begin playing <i>Network Tag</i>,
Copy <i>MyImage.bmp</i> from your MP4 directory
to your MP5 directory. 
<p>
When the game first begins, one player may become <i>it</i> by pressing the 
left mouse button.  For the rest of the game, 
<i>It</i>  is transferred by contact with another player.  
when we become <i>it</i>, we cannot <i>tag back</i> 
the player that just touched us (i.e., no tag-backs).  
Pressing the right mouse
is a cheat buttom that releases <i>it</i>.
<p>
We can leave the game at any time by pressing both the left and 
right mouse buttons at the same time.
Just before we exit, we send a GOODBYE message to the other players in
the game to let them know we are no longer active in the game.
<p>
Run the program in the lab on one or more 
machines until you understand how it works. 
<p>
If MP5 doesn't run on your home machine, 
it is because NetBIOS is not properly installed on your machine.
For this MP, it is suggested that you work in the lab.

<h2>Network Protocol</h2>
As described above, there are three
types of messages are exhanged between players: HELLO, UPDATE, and GOODBYE.
All messages begin with a byte that identifies the message type.
The next byte of the message identifies the player that sent the message.
The rest of the bytes contain the message data.
The structure definitions for these messages are 
given at the beginning MP5.ASM.  
<p>
Multicast Datagrams are used to transmit messages among players.
All Messages are sent to a NetBIOS group called <i>ECE291MP5</i> are received
by all players in the game.  When a player first joins they game, they
are given the first available name between 
<i>ECE291Player00</i> and <i>ECE291Player63</i>.  
<p>
To simplify the programming for NetBIOS, you have been given NETLIB.LIB --
a library which provides function calls to send and receive datagrams.
The NetLIB library calls are summarized below.
Additional documentation about NetBIOS and Lockwood's NetLIB functions 
can be found on our 
<a href="http://www.ece.uiuc.edu/~ece291/class-resources/">ECE291 
Class Resources</a> Web Page.
<p>
<blockquote><font size=-1><xmp>
NetInit:    Initializes Network - Returns: Player num in AL
SendPacket: Transmits data in TXBuffer - Inputs: AX = Length
NetRelease: Release network resources 

netpost : Procedure called when datagram arrives.
          Called with AX = Length, BX = Pointer to RXBuffer
          Must preserve all registers modified
          Ends with RET (not IRET)

TXBuffer: Transmit Buffer (1024 bytes) - Write your data here 
RXBuffer: Receive Buffer  (1024 bytes) - Read from here !
</xmp></font></blockquote>

<h2>Important Variables</h2>

To understand how network tag operates, consider 
the information stored at each node.

<ul>
<li><b>Player:</b> 64-element array of PlayerType. <br>
       Stores position and status of remote users.  <br>
       Modified when packets arrive and used to redraw the screen.
<li><b>ImageArray:</b> 64-element array of 1024-byte, uncompressed images.<br>
       Holds local copy of remote user images.
<li><b>MyNum</b>: My player number (as determined by NetINIT)
<li><b>ItNum</b>: The number of the player that I think is it.
<li><b>TagNum</b>: The number of the player that tagged me
<li><b>MyPosition</b>: My location on the screen (an from the top-left offset)
</ul>
<h2>Problem Assignment </h2>
To help you save time, I have given you the source code for the main 
procedure.   This code controls the flow of the game and
transmits packets to the other players in the game.  
It is your job to first read and understand this code.
You will then complete the program
using your own routines from parts I and II of this MP.
<p>
You may cut & paste your graphic routines from MP4
into MP5.ASM.  
Edit MP5.ASM to add your new procedures for 
mouse control, data reception, and updating the screen.




<h2>Network, Mouse, and Screen Routines</h2>
<ul>
<li><i>All routines should preserve the values of
       any registers modified</i>
<li><i>Use proper segments where needed</i><p>

<li><font size=+2><b>MouseMove</b></font>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> Position self on the screen 
      at the location of the mouse
  <li><b>Variables Updated</b>
    <ul>
    <li>MyPosition: Sets <i>MyPosition</i> to correspond to mouse location<br>
       <ul>
       <li>Recall that <i>MyPosition</i> is specified to be the screen
           offset for the top-left corner of <i>MyImage</i>.
       <li>Limit the range of <i>MyPosition</i> to prevent drawing
           <i>MyImage</i> to the extreme right or extreme bottom of the
           the screen.
       </ul>
    <li>ItNum/TagNum: Set <i>ItNum=MyNum</i> and 
          <i>TagNum=63</i> if left button pressed <br>
        (allow me to become <i>it</i>)
    <li>ItNum/TagNum: Set <i>ItNum=63</i> if right button pressed <br>
        (force self to not be <i>it</i>)
    <li>ExitFlag: Set <i>ExitFlag=1</i> if right mouse button pressed <Br>
        (allow program to exit)
    </ul>
  <li><b>Hints</b>
    <ul>
    <li>MouseMove can poll the mouse position using an Int 33h routine.
    <li>Recall that mouse positions range over X=(0..639) and Y=(0..199).
    <li>Note that <i>MyPosition</i> is based on a screen resolution of 320x200.
    </ul>
  </ul><p>

<li><font size=+2><b>ReDrawScreen</b></font>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> Redraw the screen with up to 63 players
  <li><b>Array Variable Used: </b> Player
  <li><b>Output: </b> Writes directly to screen
  <li><b>Calls Functions: </b> DrawBox, DrawEmptyBox, DrawBMP
  <li><b>Description</b>: 
    Redraw each ACTIVE player on the screen at their current position.<br>
    Outline the player with an empty box when they are <i>it</i>. <br>
    If a player is DEPARTING, remove their image and set their staus
    to INACTIVE.

   </ul><p>

<li><font size=+2><b>NetPost</b></font>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> Process Incoming Datagrams 
  <li><b>Array Variables Modified: </b> Player
  <li><b>Output registers: </b> None! (processed within an interrupt)
  <li><b>Calls Functions: </b> StoreBMP 
  <li><b>Description</b>: The NetPost function is called by 
        NetLIB whenever a datagram
        arrives.  The actions taken depend on the message type.
        <ul>
        <li>HELLO: Set the player status to active
            and store their image to the array.
        <li>UPDATE: 
          <ul>
          <li>Update the player's current position. <br>
          <li>If some other player is <i>it</i> AND that player 
              overlapping me AND that player wasn't tagged by me, 
               then I should become <i>it</i>.
               (ItNum=MyNum, TagNum=PlayerNum). <br>
          <li>If some other player is <i>it</i> AND that player 
              is NOT overlapping me
               then let him/her become <i>it</i>
                (ItNum=PlayerNum). <br>
          <li>If some other player is <i>it</i> AND that player 
               was tagged by me, let him/her continue to be <i>it</i> 
               then let him/her become <i>it</i>
                (ItNum=PlayerNum). <br>
           </ul>
        <li>GOODBYE: Set the player status to departing.
              Let the ReDrawScreen take care of removing
              the user from the screen.
        </ul>

  <li><b>Hints:</b>
     <ul>
     <li>You will receive messages from yourself!
     </ul>

    </ul>
  </ul><p>

<hr>
<h2>Points</h2>
You will earn the following points for replacing each of the subroutines
with your own code.

<ul>
<li>MouseMove: 15 pts
<li>ReDrawScreen: 15 pts
<li>NetPost: 20 pts 
</ul>


<h2>Preliminary Procedure </h2> 
<ol>
<li>Obtain the MP5 files by downloading them from the web as 
    <a href="mp5.zip">mp5.zip</a> or 
    copying them from the netork drive with the following command:<br>
      <tt>xcopy /s V:\ECE291\MP5\ W:\MP5</tt> <br>
<li>Copy the 'myimage.bmp' you created for MP4 into your MP5 directory: <br>
      <tt>copy W:MP4\MyImage.bmp W:\MP5</tt>
<li>Run the code in the lab to understand how it works.  Experiment
     with the operation of the left mouse button, the right mouse 
     button, and pressing both the left and right mouse buttons 
     together.
<li>Read the existing code given in MP5.ASM.  Be sure that you understand
     the program framework before you write the individual routines.
