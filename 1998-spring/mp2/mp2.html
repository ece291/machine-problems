<h2>Introduction</h2>
   Compression is extremely useful
   for data such as text, images, sound, and video.
  Compression allows audio files (such as MP3s) to be compressed 
  to a fraction of their original size, permits hundreds of channels 
  of video to be transmitted through a single digital satellite system (DSS);
  enables a modem to achieve higher throughput, and can increase the
  storage capacity of a disk or tape drive.
  <p>
   Non-lossy compression algorithms, such as the one studied in this MP,
   completely preserve the data they compress.
   By representing the most frequently recurring data patterns 
   using the smallest bit sequence, the total size of the data can 
   be greatly reduced.
  <p> 
  In this MP, we will write an interactive assembly program
  that encodes and decodes text messages using Huffman compression.
  The text message will consist of symbols that include:
  the 26 letters ('A'..'Z'), the space (' '), and the asterisk ('*').  
  Each symbol will be represented using a variable-bit-length encoding.

<h2>Huffman Encoding</h2>
  In general, the generation of an optimal Huffman encoding table
  is data dependent.
  The first step requires scanning through a document 
  to determine each symbol's frequency of occurance.
  Next, each symbol is represented as a node in a graph,
  with a weight equal to its probability of occurance.  
  <p>
  The main body of the algorithm involves sequentially combining  
  the least frequenctly occuring pairs of nodes into a tree-structured
  supernode.  The parent of a supernode is given a weight equal 
  to the sum of the weighs of the children.  The algorithm continues
  combining nodes and supernodes until all nodes have been combined 
  into a single tree.  Once finished, all 
  of the symbols appear as leaves in the tree.
  <p>
  The encoding of the symbols is determined by assigning '0' and '1' values
  to the branches of the tree.  The encoded value is determined by
  following the branches of the tree, starting at the root.
  The number of bits required
  to represent a symbol is equal to the depth of the leaf.  Frequent
  letters are represented with fewer bits, while infrequent letters are
  represented with more. 
  <p>
  For this MP, you are given the Huffman encoding table.  This table
  was generated using Prof. Lockwood's PhD dissertation 
  as a representative sample of standard writing.  
  <i>(The question of whether or not Prof. Lockwood's writing actually 
  reflects standard writing is an entirely different question...)</i>. 
  A Perl script was run that scanned the entire file and counted
  the frequency of each letter in the document.  The results of this
  are shown below:<p>

  <table border=1><tr><Td><tt>
 e 0.121 t 0.105 i 0.081 o 0.072 a 0.068 n 0.065 s 0.062 r 0.061 c 0.046<br>
 h 0.044 l 0.043 u 0.033 d 0.033 p 0.030 m 0.028 f 0.024 g 0.019 b 0.017<br>
 w 0.014 v 0.012 y 0.009 k 0.005 q 0.004 x 0.003 z 0.001 j 0.001</td></tr>
</table><p>

  As expected, vowels and common letters such as 'E', 'T', 'I', and 'O' 
  appeared most often.
  The letters 'Z' and 'J' appeared least frequently.
 Using the algorithm described above, 
 the following encoding tree was generated:
  <i>(The space and asterisk symbols were added 
later by splitting the nodes for nodes for S and V)</i>

  <p><img src="huffman-tree.gif" width="431" height="221"><p>

  In this tree, the letter 'E' can be found by following the right-left-right 
branches.  By assigning '0' and and '1' values to the left 
and right branches, respectively, this corresponds to an encoding
pattern of <tt>101</tt>.  Likewise, the letter 'Z' has an encoding of:
<tt>110000110</tt>.  Note that decoding of Huffman codes is somewhat
tricky due to the fact that symbols can be represented with
a differing number of bits.  


<p>
  Messages and documents can be formed by appending symbols together.
The message 'HELLO', for example, can be compactly represented 
with only 22 bits as: <tt>00101 101 00100 00100 0001</tt>.  To clearify
the encoding, spaces were shown between the symbols.  In memory, however,
adjacent symbols would occupy adjacent bit positions.  In general, 
we will be treating memory as an array of bits.  Because the
symbols do not fall on even byte boundries, it is up to the decoding algorithm
to decide where one symbol stops and the next begins.
<p>

<h2>User Interface</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>You are given the framework of a program which provides
      a menu-driven interface. <p>

  <li>By selecting an option from the menu, the user can:
      <ul>
      <li>Enter text message or binary data
      <li>Print the contents of the message or buffer
      <li>Encode a message or decode the buffer
      </ul><p>

  <li>All binary data is entered and displayed from left-to-right with
      the <i>Least Significant Bit (LSB)</i> first.

  </ul>

<h2>Sample Input & Output</h2>
<ul>

<li>Results from a sample run of the program are shown below:<br>
    (<b>Boldface</b> letters are were provided as input)<p>
<table border=1><tr><td><tt>---------- MP2 Menu -----------<br>

<b>E</b><tt> Compressed Size = 22 bits ~= 2 bytes.  (LSBit .. MSBit)<br>
00101101 00100001 000001</tt> </pre></td></tr></table>
    <p>

<li>To understanding the program, run the library-based MP2.EXE 
    program interactively.
    Try compressing and decompressing your own data.
<p>

<li>A sample input data, <tt>test1.in</tt>, is included with this MP.  <br>
    Use the following command to pipes this file into MP2: <br>
    <tt>mp2 &lt test1.in</tt><br>
    Your results should match <tt>test1.out</tt>. 
<p>

<li>Your program should work for all types of data.  <Br>
    TAs will provide you with additional test cases when you demo your MP.
</ul>


<h2>Data Structures</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>A few variables have already been defined for you in the program
      framework.  <p>
     <ul>
     <li><b>TextMsg</b>: String of ASCII bytes holding un-encoded text.<br>
          The end of this string should be always be marked with 
          the '$' character.  <p>
     <li><b>Buffer</b>: A <i>packed</i> array of bytes that hold the
         Huffman-encoded data. <br> 
         The first huffman code begins with the least 
         significant bit (LSBit) of the first byte (Buffer[0]) in the array.
         The next huffman code begins at the next bit location in the buffer.
         Note that one variable-length symbol may overlap multiple 
         byte locations, and that no bits are wasted between symbols.<p>
     <li><b>BufferLength</b>: A word which indicates how many
         bits are stored in buffer.<p>
     <li><b>HuffCodes</b>: An array of structures that 
         that define how symbols are encoded.<br>
         This table is defined in the file HUFFCODE.INC
         and is <tt>Include</tt>'d into MP2.ASM.
         For each of the 28 symbols (letters+space+asterisk), 
         this array contains: the 
         ASCII letter, the Huffman-encoded bit pattern (in two formats),
         and the number of bits in the symbol.
         The DownEncoding specifies the symbol with the most significant
         bit listed first.  The UpEncoding specifies the same symbol 
         in reverse bit order (i.e., with the Least significant bit first).
         Both formats are given for your convenience. 
         It is easy to confuse the bit ordering.
         Recall that MASM and CodeView both present data 
         with the most significant bit listed first. 
        
     </ul> <p>
   <li>A few constants have also been defined:<p>
     <ul>
     <li><b>TextMsgMaxLength</b> == 70 <i>bytes</i></b>,<br>
        i.e., Just less than one line of full-screen text.<p>
     <li><b>BufferMaxLengthBits</b> == 9*TextMsgMaxLength <i>bits</i>,<br>
        i.e., the longest encoding times the longest Buffer length.<p>
     <li><b>BufferMaxLength</b> == 1+BufferMaxLengthBits/8 <i>bytes</i>,<br>
        Number of bytes required to hold Buffer, rounded up to next byte.
     </ul>
  </ul>

<h2>Procedures</h2>

  <ul>
  <li>This assignment has eight procedures.  
      You will receive credit for this
      assignment by replacing each of the eight
      procedures listed below with your own code.  
  <li>Experiment with the working code 
      to gain a full understanding of how the programs works.
  <li>Your program should exactly match the functionality of the library 
      subroutines.
  <li>All subroutines should be <i>modular</i>.  They should use the stack to
      <i>preserve</i> the value of any registers they may modify.  
  <li>Five of the fifty points are earned by comparing the
      effiency of your your code against the library routines.

    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Preliminary Procedure</h2>
<ul>
<li>Copy the 
    empty MP2 program (<tt>MP2.ASM</tt>), 
    huffman encoding table (<tt>HUFFCODE.INC</tt>),
    sample input file (<tt>test1.in</tt>),
    corresponding output files (<tt>test1.out</tt>),
    libraries (<tt>libmp2.lib</tt>, <tt>lib291.lib</tt>), and 
    <tt>Makefile</tt> from the network drive to your home directory
    with the following command: <br>
    <tt>xcopy /s I:\ece291\mp2 F:\mp2</tt><br>
    Alternatively, from home, you can download the same files as 
    <a href="mp2.zip">mp2.zip</a>.
<li>As with MP0 and MP1, run <tt>NMake</tt> to build an executable program 
    using the given ECE291 library functions.
<li>As with MP0 and MP1, use a text editor to modify the program.
    As given, the program uses LIBMP2 routines 
    to implement all
    functionality.  To receive full credit for the assignment,
    you will need to implement each of the subroutines described above with
    your own code.
<li>As with MP0 and MP1, use CodeView (<tt>CV</tt>) to debug and test your 
    program.
    Because you only receive credit for procedures that function completely
    as specified, it is best to debug each routine individually.  
<li>By modifying a few comments, you can mix and match usage of your 
    own code and Library routines.  You may notice that the LIBMP2
    routines contain extraneous and difficult-to-read code.  They 
    are not meant to be unassembled!
</ul>



<h2>Final Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Print a copy of the <a href="mp2grade.html">MP2 grading sheet</a>.
<li>Demonstrate MP2.EXE to a TA or to the instructor.  
  <ul>
   <li>Be prepared to answer questions about any aspect of the operation 
       of your program.  The TAs will not accept an MP if you cannot fully
       explain all operations of your code.
  <li>Your program must work for all possible data patterns.
      Additional test patterns will be listed on the grade sheet.
  <li>The TA will determine performance points using a sample message
  </ul>
<li>Handin in your program by running: <br>
    <tt>A:\Handin </tt> <i>YourWindowsLogin</i>
<li>Print <font color="red">MP2.ASM </font>
<li>Staple the MP2 grading sheet to the front of your MP2.ASM file
    and give both to the same TA that approved your demonstration.

COMMENT * Data Compression.

          For this MP, you will write an interactive program which uses
          Huffman compression to compress and decompress textual data.
          By represents the most frequently used letters with the
          smallest number of bits, Huffman encoding can achieve
          significant data compression.
