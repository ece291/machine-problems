<CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER>

<H2>
About this Machine Problem</H2>
In the 1870's a man by the name of Samuel Lloyd shocked and amazed a simple-minded
world with an equally simple-minded puzzle.&nbsp; His puzzle consisted
of a wooden box in which there were 15 numbered blocks.&nbsp; The blocks
were placed at random into the box, and the goal was to shift the blocks
around until the blocks lined up sequentially with the '1' block in the
upper left hand corner of the board.&nbsp; This puzzle has become what
is known as the "15-Puzzle."&nbsp; After taking the world by storm a mere
century ago, the classic 15-Puzzle now lives out its mundane life as a
cheap corporate giveaway at the Engineering EXPO.&nbsp; In this machine
problem, we will attempt to restore the 15-Puzzle to its former glory.
<H2>
How the Puzzle Works</H2>
The operation of the puzzel is best explained using the concepts
your learned in ECE340 (yes, really, the semiconductor class).
Fundamentally, Our 15-puzzle works not by moving numbered tiles
around, but by moving the <I>hole</I> around.&nbsp; When the user clicks
on the 15 tile (Figure 2), the tile slides to the right to fill in the
gap, right?&nbsp; Wrong.&nbsp; Think of this as the hole sliding over to
the left to fill in the space previously occupied by the 15 tile.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="figure2.gif" HEIGHT=103 WIDTH=391></CENTER>

<CENTER>Figure 2.</CENTER>
&nbsp;
<BR>By thinking of the problem as "moving the hole around" instead of "moving
the tiles around," we simplify the coding experience.&nbsp; The core of
this functionality is the <B>MoveHole</B> subroutine.&nbsp; This routine
accepts a direction as input, and attempts to move the hole in the specified
direction.&nbsp; If the direction is invalid, <B>MoveHole</B> returns an
error code.&nbsp; An example of an invalid move would be attempting to
move the hole down on the puzzle in figure 2.
<p>

Although <I>we </I>know
that it is the <I>hole</I> that is moving, the user sees the <I>tile</I>
sliding into the place previously occupied by the hole.&nbsp; <B>MoveHole</B>
accomplishes this by repeated calls to the <B>DrawTile</B> subroutine.&nbsp;
<B>DrawTile</B> simply draws the specified tile at the specified location.&nbsp;
The "animated" effect is achieved by repeatedly drawing the tile, each
time moving it over by one character until it reaches its destination.
Calling the <B>Delay</B> subroutine each time the tile is drawn slows the
animation down.&nbsp; <B>Delay</B> simply burns clock cycles so that the
animation appears at human-detectable speed.&nbsp; Without some sort of
delay, the animation would be instantaneous to the human eye.
<p> 

The state of the game board is stored in the <B>Board</B> variable.&nbsp; This
is simply an array of bytes indicating which tiles are in each of the 16
possible positions (numbered 0...15).&nbsp; The hole is represented as
tile 0.&nbsp; The variable <B>HolePtr</B> always contains the position
of the hole.&nbsp; In addition, the <B>Moves</B> variable always contains
the number of moves the user has made.&nbsp; 
<p>

The mouse control is implemented
in the <B>MouseControl</B> subroutine.&nbsp; Using the mouse as an input
device is straightforward, and the details are contained in the lab manual.&nbsp;
<B>MouseControl</B> returns a value indicating which tile or button was
clicked.&nbsp; The Main routine (given) takes this value and decides what
action to take.&nbsp; If a tile is clicked, Main calls the <B>CheckMove</B>
routine, which checks if the click was valid, and if so, calls <B>MoveHole</B>
to effect the desired move.&nbsp; Note that the user should be able to
click on any tile in line with the hole.&nbsp; In figure 2 (farthest to
right), clicking on the 3 tile should cause the 11, 7, and 3 tiles to move
downward.&nbsp; The full details of these subroutines are given below.
<H2>
The Autosolve "Algorithm"</H2>
When complete, your machine problem will amaze your non-engineering
friends with its ability to automagically solve itself.
Of course, we engineers know that
there is no magic involved.&nbsp; Rather, this puzzle will use the stack
to perform the amazing autosolve feat. Whenever a move is made, 
the <I>opposite</I> move is pushed onto the stack.&nbsp; 
The number of moves currently residing
on the stack is kept track of using the <B>MovesPushed</B> variable.
<p>

To solve the puzzle, the <B>AutoSolve</B> subroutine simply pops the moves
off of the stack and calls <B>MoveHole</B>. The <B>Shuffle</B> routine
resets the puzzle and then moves the hole in random directions.&nbsp; The
number of times the hole is moved is specified by <B>ShuffAmount</B>.&nbsp;
Your <B>Shuffle</B> routine should take care not to move the hole in one
direction and then follow that by moving the hole right back to where it
started again.&nbsp; That sort of behavior is not very impressive and it
is annoying to watch.&nbsp; 
<p>

The randomness is achieved by generating random
numbers with the <B>Random</B> routine.&nbsp; 
The method for generating random numbers is outlined below.&nbsp; 

Each time <B>Shuffle</B> moves
the hole, the <I>opposite</I> move is pushed onto the stack for later retrieval
by the <B>AutoSolve</B> routine.&nbsp; In this manner, the puzzle can solve
itself after being shuffled and then played with.&nbsp; Be careful when
using the stack to store moves.&nbsp; You will be using the same stack
that the CPU uses to store return addresses for subroutine calls.&nbsp;
Review your lecture notes on stack usage.
<H2>
A Few Other Things</H2>
<ul>
<li>The <B>Reset</B> routine will restore the board to its original, in-order
configuration.&nbsp; <B>Reset</B> will also pop all existing moves off
of the stack.&nbsp; 
<li><B>DrawBoard</B> is the routine that will draw all
of the static elements of the Graphical User Interface.&nbsp; Buttons,
title bars, borders, and backgrounds are all "static" elements of 
the display.&nbsp; These do not change and generally only need to be drawn once.
<B>DrawBoard</B>
also draws the current arrangement of tiles, specified in the <B>Board</B>
array.&nbsp; Your puzzle game will display the current number of moves
the user has made.&nbsp; It will also display the current setting of the
<B>DelayC</B> constant.&nbsp; 
<li><B>UpdateScreen</B> is the routine which
draws these displays into place.&nbsp; <B>UpdateScreen</B> is called any
time the <B>Moves</B> variable or the <B>DelayC</B> variable changes.
</ul>

<H2>
Play With It</H2>
The best way to get the feel for how the game should operate is to play
with the library version of the game.&nbsp; Your version must implement
all the features of the library version.&nbsp; If you have a question as
to how your program should behave, look at the library code and have your
version do what it does.&nbsp; You may use some degree of artistic license
in your version, but be aware that if you change the locations of buttons
or tiles, your code will not interoperate properly with the library code.&nbsp;
The best strategy is to place all of your screen elements in the same places
as the library code.
<H2>
Efficiency</H2>
Many of the operations of this Machine Problem can be implemented most
efficiently with loops, lookup tables, and bit-tricks.&nbsp; In this case,
efficient = simple. Many of those same operations can be very tedious and
time-consuming to program if you do not choose efficient ways to implement
them.&nbsp; We will not explicitly test the speed of your code for this
MP, but the benefit derived from efficient coding is that you will have
many more free-time hours to pursue leisure activities such as playing
with the 15-puzzle that some company gave out free at the last EXPO.
<H2>
80x50 Text Mode Video</H2>
You will be using text-mode video graphics to display the game on the screen.&nbsp;
You will be using direct video memory writes as described in the lecture
notes.&nbsp; Using 80x50 text mode is a simple extension of what you know
about 80x25 text mode.&nbsp; You simply double the size of the memory page
to which you will write data.
<H2>
Data Structures</H2>

<UL>
<LI>
A few variable have been defined in the program framework.&nbsp; Use them.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>Moves</B>: keeps track of the number of moves the used has made.&nbsp;
This must be updated every time MoveHole returns successful.</LI>

<LI>
<B>MovesPushed</B>: tracks the number of moves that have been pushed to
the stack.&nbsp; This is not necessarily equal to the Moves variable.</LI>

<LI>
<B>HolePtr</B>: always contains the current position of the hole.&nbsp;
A position is a number 0...15 representing the offset into the Board array
where the hole is stored.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Board</B>: is an array of bytes representing the state of the board.&nbsp;
Each byte position contains a number 0...15 representing which tile is
in that position.&nbsp; For example, if the 6 tile is located in the lower
left hand corner of the board, then Board[12]=6.&nbsp; The hole is represented
as tile number 0.</LI>

<LI>
<B>RandVal</B>: contains the seed used by the random number generator.</LI>

<LI>
<B>DelayC</B>: contains the delay constant.&nbsp; This delay constant is
a number 1...20.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>
&nbsp;Preliminary Procedure</H2>

<UL>
<LI>
Copy the empty MP3 program (<TT>MP3.ASM</TT>), libraries (<TT>libmp3.lib</TT>,
<TT>lib291.lib</TT>), and <TT>Makefile</TT> from the network drive to your
home directory with the following command:</LI>

<BR><TT>xcopy /s I:\ece291\mp3 F:\mp3</TT>
<BR>Alternatively, from home, you can download the same files as <A HREF="mp3.zip">mp3.zip</A>.
<LI>
As with previous MPs, run <TT>NMake</TT> to build an executable program
using the given ECE291 library functions.</LI>

<LI>
As with previous MPs, use a text editor to modify the program. As given,
the program uses LIBMP3 routines to implement all functionality. To receive
full credit for the assignment, you will need to implement each of the
subroutines described above with your own code.</LI>

<LI>
As with previous MPs, use CodeView (<TT>CV</TT>) to debug and test your
program. Because you only receive credit for procedures that function completely
as specified, it is best to debug each routine individually.</LI>

<LI>
By modifying a few comments, you can mix and match usage of your own code
and Library routines. You may notice that the LIBMP3 routines contain extraneous
and difficult-to-read code. They are not meant to be unassembled!</LI>
</UL>

<H2>
Final Steps</H2>
