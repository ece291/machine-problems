<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The use of any text editor or word processor quickly reveals some
basic operations common across platforms and programs.  In this machine
problem you will develop some basic searching functions and simple
variations.  Your program will take an input file, print the file, display
statistics on the file, and match a string for counting, finding, or
replacing parts of the file. </p>

<h2>Problem Description</h2>

<p>The file to be manipulated will be entered through an INCLUDE statement.
Include files are read into the source at assemble time.
The include file contains one variable: <tt>file</tt>.  This can be used as the
offset for the beginning of the file data.  It can be assumed that all
files end with and EOF marker.  You might also note that the file has
been formatted for our use.  This is only to postpone having to use file
operations until you are more familiar with assembly.  The conversion is
fairly straightforward. </p>

<p>The file can be thought of as a large array where characters are stored in
contiguous bytes in memory.  You will be manipulating this file with a
number of procedures depending on the command line arguments.  The command
line arguments are stored in a section of memory called the PSP (Program
Segment Prefix).  The main procedure takes care of pulling the necessary
arguments from the PSP for our use.  This is similar to <i>argc</i> and
<i>argv</i> in C.  The main procedure is provided for you, however, you
must supply a routine that is used to copy the input strings from the PSP
to the variables <tt>String1</tt> and <tt>String2</tt>.</p>

<p>In this machine problem you will replace the procedures from the LIBMP1
library by commenting out the <tt>extrn</tt> statements, uncommenting
the routine definitions, and adding your code.  Each routine that you write
should match the output of the library code exactly.  Each of the commands
and their functionality is described below in the <b>Commands</b> section.
The best way to get a feel for the program is to run it using various
commands and options, to see how it is supposed to operate.</p>

<p>Your program is required to:
<ul>
<li>Display the file, pausing every <tt>PauseLength</tt> lines, until the user
        hits a key to continue.
<li>Determine and display statistics for the given file.  These include
        <ul>
        <li>File length
        <li>Number of Characters
        <li>Number of Words
        </ul>
    Variables are defined for the above values to use as needed.
<li>Count and display the number of matches for a given input string.
<li>Find and display each occurrence of a given input string.  Pause on each
        occurrence and wait for the user to proceed.
<li>Find, replace, and display each occurrence of a given input string with
        a second string.  This should also pause on each replaced string as
        it displays.

<h2>Commands</h2>
<p>All commands for this program are entered on the command line.
A summary of the command set is shown below:</p>
                               
<p>
<center><table border="1" cellspacing="1">
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><strong>Command Line Options</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><pre>Usage: MP1 [dscfr] [option]
  d = display the file
  s = print statistics
  c [string] = count the number of times &lt string &gt appears in the file
  f [string] = find each occurrence of &lt string &gt in the file
  r [string1] [string2] = replace &lt string1 &gt in the file with &lt string2 &gt
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center></p>


<p>The file can be printed by using
the 'd' command in the following manner:<br>
<tt>W:/mp1>mp1 d</tt><br>
This will call the DisplayFile routine to
dump the contents of the file on to the screen.  Only the first command
entered on the line will be used for input.  If the command requires a
string then the string must be present or an error will be displayed.</p>
<p>For instance in order to replace the string <i>Yes</i> with <i>No</i> you
would use the 'r' command in the following manner:
<tt>W:/mp1>mp1 r Yes No</tt><br>
Other commands operate in a similar manner.

<h2>Hints</h2>
<ul>
<li>The LIBMP1 file contains executable library functions for each of the
routines that you need to implement.  
This allows you to run the program and understand how it works before you 
implement it.  You can test your program with any combination of your own
code and library functions.  You will only receive credit, however, for
the routines that you implement yourself. <p>

<li>When debugging your code in Codeview, you will find it helpful to use
the memory window to show you the memory location of the file and strings.
You can also use the watch window to keep track of variables in your code.<p>

<li>Do not assume that the file starts at memory location 0.<p>

<li>You may define new variables as needed.<p>

<li>You might find it very helpful to write your own helper function that
finds the next occurrence of a &lt string &gt in the file starting at 
any offset in the file.  This function could then be used in the procedures
Count, Find, and Replace.<p>

<li>Be very careful if you call another procedure not to destroy registers
that the calling procedure uses.<p>

<li>START EARLY!  This is the first MP that requires you to write your
own program.  Composition is much more difficult than comprehension.<p>

<li>Monitor the <a href="news:uiuc.class.ece291">newsgroup</a> for clarifications and help.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Subroutines</h2>

<p>This assignment has six procedures. You will receive credit by replacing
each of these six procedures listed below with your own code.

</table>

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ul>
<li>You will begin this MP with the following files:
    <ul>
    <li><tt>MP1.ASM</tt>: Program Framework
    <li><tt>&lt FILE &gt.DAT</tt>: Files formatted for manipulation
    <li><tt>Makefile</tt>: Specifies how and when programs are assembled
        and linked.
    <li><tt>LIBMP1.LIB</tt>: Library functions for MP1
    <li><tt>LIB291.LIB</tt>: General-purpose library functions
    </ul>
<li>You may copy these files from the network drive to your home directory
    with the following command: <br>
    <tt>xcopy /s V:\ece291\mp1 W:\mp1</tt><br>
    or download the files from this server as <a href="mp1.zip">mp1.zip</a> 
<li>Add your code to <tt>MP1.ASM</tt>.
<li>Assemble and link your program by typing<br>
      <tt>nmake</tt><Br>
    This command reads <i>Makefile</i> then invokes MASM and LINK to build 
    an executable program.  
<li>Use CodeView (CV) to find and correct program errors. 
<li>Verify your program operation by testing with
    each command on various input files.
</ul>

<h2>Final Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Print a copy of the MP1 grading report (<a href="mp1grade.html">MP1GR</a>).
   Double-check that your program is ready for demonstration.  You need to
   run through the test cases on the grading sheet, you WILL NOT be allowed
   to hand-in unless you have done this step.
  <li>Print MP1.ASM (Use GreenPrint32 to print at 4 pages/side.) 
  <li>Demonstrate your MP1.EXE to a TA or to the instructor. You may
   be asked to recompile and demonstrate MP1 with different input files.
   Your program must work with all given
   input. </li>
  <li>Be prepared to answer questions about any aspect of the operation of
   your program. The TAs will not accept an MP if you cannot fully explain
   the operation of your code and details of your implementation. Delayed
   MPs will be subject to late penalties as described in the course
   syllabus (10pts/day).</li>
  <li>The TA will copy your program to the demonstration disk.
  <li>Take your printouts to the same TA which approved your demonstration.
    Staple the grading sheet to the front of the MP1.ASM printout.  Be sure
    that your name appears in your code and on the grading sheet.
</ol>
