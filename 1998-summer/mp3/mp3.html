<h2>Introduction</h2>
  In this MP we will be developing the game of Black Jack.  This is a
  simple card game that is very popular in casino's around the world.
  Hopefully, this MP will not fuel anyones gambling addiction.
<p>
  The premise of the games is to be dealt cards that total up to 21 but do
  not exceed that amount.  Normal play is against a dealer who gets to
  draw cards after you.  For clarification lets call the two players the dealer
  (computer) and the user (person playing the program.)
  The dealer also only has one card showing during the user
  card selection.  Both players (Dealer and User) are dealt two cards
  initially.  Only one of the dealer cards is visible.  The user must then
  make a decision to ask for another card (if they think they can get closer
  to 21 without going over), or they may stay and let the dealer try
  to get 21.
<p>
  Though Black Jack played in Las Vegas has additional rules and betting
  possibilities (such as split, double, etc.), we will be playing by a very
  simple set of rules.  Following is the ECE291 Black Jack Guidelines:
<ul>
<li>  Each bet is worth a fixed amount of money.
<li>  The player with the card total closest to 21 without going over is
      considered the winner of that deal.
<li>  If the dealer wins the user loses the amount equal to the bet.
<li>  If the user wins the user gains an amount equal to the bet.
<li>  If the result is a draw (tie), then no amount of money is changed.
<li>  The game continues until the user quits, loses an amount that exceeds
      the declared minimum, or wins an amount that exceeds the declared
      maximum.
</ul>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
   Your implementation of this program should follow that of the library
   code.  You will use text mode graphics to display the necessary GUI
   (Graphical User Interface) to the screen.  All input will be through
   the mouse.
<p>
   Your program should do the following:
   <ul>
   <li>Display the 5 buttons on the right with the game choices.
   <li>Use Mouse input to determine which functions to perform.
   <li>Randomly choose cards from a deck for dealing.
   <li>Reinitialize to a new deck when all cards from the old deck are used.
   <li>Graphically display all card values to the screen.
   <li>Perform the computer AI for the dealer.
   <li>Calculate the value of each players hand.
   <li>Determine the winner based on the total in each hand.
   <li>Keep track of the user score in dollars, and display to the screen.
   </ul>
   
                        
<h2>User Interface</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>You are given the framework of a program which provides
      a menu-driven interface. Run the library version to get a feel for
      how the program should operate, and what functions result from
      each button press.<p>

  <li>By selecting an option from the menu with the mouse, the user can:
      <ul>
      <li>[Restart] to begin the game with a new deck.
      <li>[Deal] to have the dealer start a new hand (using the same deck).
      <li>[Hit] to add another card to the user hand.
      <li>[Stay] to finish the user hand and allow the dealer to finish.
      <li>[Quit] to exit the game.
      </ul><p>

  </ul>

<li>The key data structure in the game is called <tt>CardArray</tt>.  This is
    an array of words that stores the current status of the deck being used.
    Each word is used to store information regarding one card.  The deck is
    initialized to <tt>DECKSIZE</tt> (52 cards in a deck).  Each time a new
    card needs to be dealt a random value is chosen and that card removed from
    the <tt>CardArray</tt>.  This hole is then replaced with the last card in
    the deck, and the size of the deck decreased by 1.
<p>
    In other words, you might think of this as laying out all the cards in a
    row.  Each time a card is chosen from the deck the last card in the row
    replaces the missing card spot.  This keeps the cards stored together in
    the array without any holes.
<p>
    The contents of each word in the array is two bytes of information.  The
    second byte is a value (0-4) to specify with which suit the card is
    associated.  The first byte is the actual number of the card (1-13).  When
    you read a word of the array into a register the high byte = suit, and the
    low byte = card number.
<p>

<li>You will also be using a number of tables in this MP for easier manipulation
    of graphics.  The table values are given to you in the program framework.
<p>

<li>A sample screen shot is shown above.  Your program should match this very
    closely though it does not have to be exact.  The location of certain
    buttons are given as constants and are described below.
<p>

<li>Your program should work for all types of input.  It should be robust to
    keypresses or mouse button presses on any area of the screen.

</ul>

<H2>80x50 Text Mode Video</H2>
You will be using text-mode video graphics to display the game on the screen.&nbsp;
You will be using direct video memory writes as described in the lecture
notes.&nbsp; Using 80x50 text mode is a simple extension of what you know
about 80x25 text mode.&nbsp; You simply double the size of the memory page
to which you will write data.


<h2>Data Structures</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>The following variables have already been defined for you in the program
      framework.  <p>
     <ul>
     <li><b>CardLength</b>: The current size of the remaining deck. <br>
           Initialized to <tt>DECKSIZE</tt> and decremented as cards are
           randomly chosen.<p>
     <li><b>CardArray</b>: The array of cards left in the deck.<br>
        1st Byte = Card Suit (<tt>HEART,DIAMOND,CLUB,SPADE</tt>)<br>
        2nd Byte = Card Number <br>
        <ul>
        <li>1 = Ace
        <li>2-10 = Card of that number
        <li>11 = Jack
        <li>12 = Queen
        <li>13 = King
        </ul><p>
     <li><b>HiddenCard</b>: This is a word that is used to store the dealer
            card that is hidden initially.  This card can then be removed
            from the card array for further deals.<p>
     <li><b>Flags</b>: This is a variable that has specific bit positions
            for various flags:<br>
            <ul>
            <li>Bit 0 = Deal only flag.  Set to restrict the user from
                performing a button operation that is illegal.
            <li>Bit 1 = Player bust flag.  Set when the user has a total
                greater than 21.
            <li>Bit 2 = Dealer bust flag.  Set when the dealer has a total
                greater than 21.
            <li>Bit 3 = GameOver flag.  Set when <tt>MIN_SCORE</tt> or
                <tt>MAX_SCORE</tt> has been exceeded.
            </ul><p>
     <li><b>DealerTot</b>: The current total of the dealers hand.<p>
     <li><b>PlayerTot</b>: The current total of the users hand.<p>
     <li><b>Score</b>: Current amount of dollars that the user has.
            Initialized to <tt>INIT_SCORE</tt>.<p>
     <li><b>Suit_Pos</b>: Address table for drawing the cards.<br>
            Each entry in the table is the address of another table
            that holds the positions of where to draw the ASCII suit
            characters.
            Each of these respective tables has as many entries as the
            number of the card (i.e. Card 6 = 6 entries, Card 10 = 10 entries),
            except face cards (Jack, Queen, King) which only have 2 entries.
            <p>
     <li><b>Zero</b>-<b>Face</b>:  Individual tables for the positions of
            the ASCII suit characters.  All values are offsets relative to
            the upper left corner of where the card is drawn.

<h2>Procedures</h2>

  <ul>
  <li>This assignment has nine procedures.  
      You will receive credit for this
      assignment by replacing each of the nine
      procedures listed below with your own code.
  <li>The tenth procedure (<b>Random</b>) you are already given and
      do not need to replace.
  <li>Experiment with the working code 
      to gain a full understanding of how the programs works.
  <li>Your program should exactly match the functionality of the library 
      subroutines.
  <li>All subroutines should be <i>modular</i>.  They should use the stack to
      <i>preserve</i> the value of any registers they may modify.  
  <li><i>Library routines only call other Library Routines.</i>&nbsp;
      Keep this in mind when testing your code with the given library code.
  </ul>


<ul>
<li><font size=+1><b>MouseControl</b></font>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> To get the user input via the mouse.
  <li><b>Inputs:</b> none
  <li><b>Outputs:</b> AX = Value of button that was hit.
        <ul>
        <li>AX = 0 (Nothing Valid pressed)
        <li>AX = 1 (Reset button pressed)
        <li>AX = 2 (Deal button pressed)
        <li>AX = 3 (Hit button pressed)
        <li>AX = 4 (Stay button pressed)
        <li>AX = 5 (Quit button pressed)
        </ul>
  <li><b>Description:</b>  This function will use software interrupts to
         determine when a mouse button has been hit and where on the screen
         it is pointing to.  Valid numbers will be returned when a button
         has been found to be pressed.  These buttons are the messages with
         blue backgrounds along the right side of the screen.
  <li><b>Notes:</b>
         <ul>
         <li>This program spends most of its time in this procedure
         waiting for the user to press a button.  The routine loops until
         the user has clicked a button (i.e. held and released the mouse
         button).
         <li>The mouse status is read via software interrupts.  Input registers
         are loaded and <tt>INT 33h</tt> is executed.
         <li>The mouse interrupt functions are documented in the lab manual.
         <li>Notice the mouse is initialized and made visible in the main routine.
         You do not need to repeat this code.
         </ul>
  <li><b>Hints:</b>
         <ul>
         <li>Think of performing functions on a button release and not a button
             press.  Why is this do you think?
         <li>Many comparisons will have to be performed in this procedure, use
             the constants defined at the top of the program.
         </ul>
  <li><b>Points:</b> 5
  </ul><p>

<li><font size=+1><b>DrawCard</b></font>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> Draws a card to the screen with the given attribute
         at the given location.
  <li><b>Inputs:</b>
        <ul>
        <li>ES = Video Segment.
        <li>AH = Suit of card to draw (0-3).
        <li>AL = Card Value (1-13).<br>
                If AL=0, then the back of the card should be drawn.
        <li>BH = Row of where to draw on the screen.
        <li>BL = Column of where to draw on the screen.
        </ul>
  <li><b>Outputs:</b> Card drawn at proper location on the screen.
  <li><b>Notes:</b>
        <ul>
        <li>This routine will take alot of code to get a card correctly drawn.
        <li>The '10' card will take some extra work since the number has
            2 digits and all other cards only have 1 digit.
        <li>Face cards only have two suit ASCII characters drawn and do not
            have pictures that have to be displayed.
        <li>A special section of code will also be needed for the case of
            an input AL = 0 for the back of the card.
        </ul>
  <li><b>Calls:</b> This function is called by <i>Hit</i>, <i>Deal</i> and 
	       <i>Stay</i>.
  <li><b>Hints:</b>
        <ul>
        <li>This is a convenient place to write a helper function that
            writes a string to the screen at a given location. (<i>DrawString</i>)
        <li>Use your tables defined above for location of suit ASCII characters.
        <li>Try breaking this down into steps. Draw a blank card.  Then draw
            the digits of the card, then draw the ASCII suit characters.
        </ul>
  <li><b>Points:</b> 8
  </ul><p>

<li><font size=+1><b>DrawBoard</b></font>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> Draws out all the static elements of the display.
  <li><b>Inputs:</b> ES = Video Segment
  <li><b>Outputs:</b> Writes to screen
  <li><b>Description:</b> This routine draws all the buttons and the static
         messages to the screen.  This includes the title, the two player
         messages, and the static section of the score message.
  <li><b>Calls:</b> This function is called by <i>ResetBoard</i> and <i>Deal</i>.
  <li><b>Hints:</b>
        <ul>
        <li>Again you might find a <i>DrawString</i> helper function convenient.
        <li>Use the constants defined at the top for message and button
         positions.
         </ul>
  <li><b>Points:</b> 5
  </ul><p>


<li><font size=+1><b>DrawScore</b></font>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> Draws the current player score to the screen.  
  <li><b>Inputs:</b> <tt>Score</tt> = Value to output.
  <li><b>Outputs:</b> Draws to screen.
  <li><b>Hints:</b>
        <ul>
        <li>This is a convenient place to use the helper function that
            writes a string to the screen at a given location. (<i>DrawString</i>)
        <li>The score part of the screen should be erased with spaces first.
        <li>The score must be converted from binary to ASCII.
        </ul>
  <li><b>Calls:</b> This function is called by <i>ResetBoard</i> and <i>Deal</i>.
  <li><b>Points:</b> 2
  </ul><p>

<li><font size=+1><b>ResetBoard</b></font>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> Reinitializes the entire game. 
  <li><b>Inputs:</b>

        <li>Score = Reset to <tt>INIT_SCORE</tt>.
        <li>[SI] = <tt>CardArray</tt> address is reinitialized with a new deck.
        <li>[DI] = <tt>CardLength</tt> address is renitialized to <tt>DECKSIZE</tt>.
        <li><tt>Flags</tt> = 00000001b (Deal only flag is set).
        <li>Screen is refreshed.
        </ul>
  <li><b>Calls:</b>  <i>DrawBoard</i> and <i>DrawScore</i>.
  <li><b>Hints:</b>
        <ul>
        <li>This might be a convenient place to use helper functions that
            clear the screen (<i>ClearScreen</i>) and initialize the card
            array back to the full deck state (<i>ArrayInit</i>).
        <li>This function is called when the game initially runs and any
            time the 'Reset' button is pressed.
        </ul>
  <li><b>Points:</b> 4
  </ul><p>


<li><font size=+1><b>Hit</b></font>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> Hit the player with a new card.

                <ul>
                <li><tt>Flags</tt> = 00000010 (Player Bust flag set)<br>
                    This blocks any 'Hit' or 'Stay' until 'Deal'
                </ul>
        <li>If last card is chosen from the deck then the deck is renitialized.
        </ul>
  <li><b>Notes:</b>
        <ul>
        <li>If upon entering this routine any flag is set
        (DEALFLAG, PLAYBUST, DEALBUST, GAMEOVER) then the routine should exit.

        <li>A helper function <i>PickCard</i> that picks a card from the deck, updates the
            array and length, and then returns the card would be helpful.
        <li>When calculating the new <tt>PlayerTot</tt> all face cards are
            worth 10.
        <li>Aces can either be worth 1 or 11.  If the Ace can be worth 11
            then count it as 11, if however this busts the player then
            only count the Ace as 1.
        <li>You can also use your <i>ArrayInit</i> helper function in this
            procedure.

<li><font size=+1><b>Deal</b></font>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> Perform an initial Deal.  Two cards go to the dealer
         (One face down), and two cards to the user/player.
  <li><b>Inputs:</b>
        <ul>        
        <li>SI = Address of <tt>CardArray</tt>.
        <li>DI = Address of <tt>CardLength</tt>.
        </ul>
  <li><b>Outputs:</b>
        <ul>
        <li>Initial cards are displayed to the screen.
        <li><tt>Flags</tt> are reset to 0. (All flags cleared).
        <li>[SI] = (<tt>CardArray</tt>) reflects new status of deck. (4 less cards)<br>
            Array is reinitialized if new deck is needed.
        <li>[DI] = (<tt>CardLength</tt>) reflects new size of deck. (4 less)
        <li><tt>PlayerTot</tt> = Cleared and recalculated.
        <li><tt>DealerTot</tt> = Cleared and recalculated.
        <li><tt>HiddenCard</tt> = Value of the face down card.
        </ul>
  <li><b>Calls:</b> Calls <i>DrawBoard</i>, <i>DrawScore</i> and <i>DrawCard</i>.<br>
         Optionally may call <i>Hit</i>.
  <li><b>Hints:</b>
        <ul>
        <li>Clear the screen before you draw the new board and score.
        <li>Use your helper function <i>PickCard</i> and <i>ArrayInit</i>.
        <li>Initial Aces will always be worth 11.

  <li><b>Purpose:</b> Perform the dealer AI for blackjack.
  <li><b>Inputs:</b> 
        <ul>

  <li><b>Outputs:</b>
        <ul>
        <li>[SI] = (<tt>CardArray</tt>) has cards removed that were drawn.
        <li>[DI] = (<tt>CardLength</tt>) is decremented by the number of

        <li><tt>DealerTot</tt> = Is updated to reflect the current total value
                        of the cards in the dealer's hand.
        <li>If dealer busts ==>

                <li><tt>Flags</tt> = 00000100 (Dealer Bust flag set)<br>
                    This blocks any 'Hit' or 'Stay' until 'Deal'
                </ul>
        <li>If last card is chosen from the deck then the deck is renitialized.
        </ul>
  <li><b>Description:</b> The dealer AI for blackjack is a simple check of
         the current total value of the dealer cards.  If <tt>DealerTot</tt>
         &gt 16 then the dealer will stay, if however <tt>DealerTot</tt>
         &lt 17 then the dealer will draw a new card.
  <li><b>Notes:</b>
        <ul>
        <li>If upon entering this routine any flag is set
        (DEALFLAG, PLAYBUST, DEALBUST, GAMEOVER) then the routine should exit.
        <li>Again do the procedure in steps.  Expose the hidden card, then
        continue to 'Hit' the dealer as required by the AI.
        </ul>
  <li><b>Calls:</b> <i>Random</i> and  <i>DrawCard</i>.
  <li><b>Hints:</b>
        <ul>
        <li>The helper function <i>PickCard</i> would again be very useful.
        <li>When calculating the new <tt>DealerTot</tt> all face cards are
            worth 10.
        <li>Aces can either be worth 1 or 11.  If the Ace can be worth 11
            then count it as 11, if however this busts the dealer then
            only count the Ace as 1.
        <li>You can also use your <i>ArrayInit</i> helper function in this
            procedure.

<li><font size=+1><b>Random</b></font>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> This routine generates and returns a pseudo-random
         number by multiplication and addition of large prime constants to
         a random number.
  <li><b>Inputs:</b> <tt>Randval</tt> memory variable
  <li><b>Outputs:</b> AX - Random number between 0 .. 2^16-1
  <li><b>Notes:</b> The random function is defined below.<br>
        R(1) = Randval<BR>
        R(i+1) = Randval = (K1 *R(i) + K2) % MaxValue&nbsp;<BR>
        Where
        <ul>
        <li><i>R(i)</i> is the random value generated in the
            i-th call to the subroutine.
        <li><i>Randval</i> is a variable that holds the initial random
            value and is updated with the result after each call to Random.
        <li><i>K1</i> and <i>K2</i> are two large, prime-valued constants.
        <li><i>MaxValue</i> = 2^16-1 (0FFFFh)
        </ul>

  <li><b>Hints:</b>
        <ul>
        <li> The first call to Random returns the orginal random number seed.
        <li> This is a library Functions that can be used where appropriate
             with no point penalty.
        </ul>
  <li><b>Points:</b> 0
  </ul><p>

</ul>

<h2>Preliminary Procedure</h2>
<ul>
<li>Copy the empty MP3 program (<tt>MP3.ASM</tt>), libraries
    (<tt>libmp3.lib</tt>,<tt>lib291.lib</tt>), and <tt>Makefile</tt> from
    the network drive to your home directory with the following command:
    <br><tt>xcopy /s V:\ece291\mp3 W:\mp3</tt>
    <br>Alternatively, from home, you can download the same files as <A HREF="mp3.zip">mp3.zip</A>.

<li>As with previous MPs, run <tt>NMake</tt> to build an executable program
    using the given ECE291 library functions.

<li>As with previous MPs, use a text editor to modify the program. As given,
    the program uses LIBMP3 routines to implement all functionality. To
    receive full credit for the assignment, you will need to implement
    each of the subroutines described above with your own code.

<li>As with previous MPs, use CodeView (<tt>CV</tt>) to debug and test your
    program. Because you only receive credit for procedures that function
    completely as specified, it is best to debug each routine individually.
</ul>



<h2>Final Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Print a copy of the <a href="mp3grade.html">MP3 grading sheet</a>.
<li>Demonstrate MP3.EXE to a TA or to the instructor.  
  <ul>
   <li>Be prepared to answer questions about any aspect of the operation 
       of your program.  The TAs will not accept an MP if you cannot fully
       explain all operations of your code.
  </ul>
<li>Handin in your program by running: <br>
    <tt>A:\Handin </tt> <i>YourWindowsLogin</i>
<li>Print <font color="red">MP3.ASM </font> using <i>
   <font color="green">GreenPrint32</font></i>
<li>Staple the MP3 grading sheet to the front of your MP3.ASM file
    and give both to the same TA that approved your demonstration.
</ol>
