<h2>Introduction</h2>
   In any type of digital communication transmitted data sent over a wire
   may contain errors when it is received.  This data corruption is usually
   due to noise on the communication medium.  In order for communication to
   be useful we need to be able to depend on the correctness of the data.
   To help solve this problem there are a number of error control
   algorithms designed to ensure the reliability of digital communication.
   These fall into two major areas: Error-correction and Error-detection.
<p>
   Error-correction is a method of including redundant information in a
   data stream so that a receiver can determine what a message with an
   error should have been.  These methods usually uses some type of
   probabilistic analysis to determine what the data is according to how
   close it is to the possible choices.
   For example, if only the numbers 1-10 were being transmitted, we
   know these can be represented with 4 bits.  However, we might choose to
   represent them with 8 bits so that an error in the byte would still be
   able to be recognized as the correct number.
<p>
   Error-detection is a more commonly used method for error control.  This
   can be attributed to its efficiency over error correction.  The extra bits
   needed for error correction are around one order of magnitude more than
   the extra bits need for simple error detection. Once an error is detected
   the sender can be notified and the original message resent.  This is the
   general method used in most network protocols including TCP/IP.
<p> 
  In this MP, we will write an interactive assembly program that encodes
  and decodes text messages using a Cyclic Redundancy Code (CRC) for
  error-detection.
  The text message will consist of symbols that include all ASCII
  characters between the space (' '), and the tilda ('~').  
  Each symbol will be added to a bit stream to calculate the CRC.

<h2>Error Detection</h2>
  The general method used for error detection is to perform some
  computation on the data being sent and append the results of this
  calculation to the sent message.  When the message is received the
  same computation is applied to the data stream and the results
  compared to the transmitted results.  If they are equal the message
  is valid, otherwise an error occurred.

<h3>Parity</h3>
  There are many different ways to approach the detection
  of errors in the transmitted message.  Let's first look at the
  simple idea of a parity bit.  One method employed is the use of an
  extra bit for every x-bits of data.  This bit, the parity bit, is
  used to signify if the number of 1's in the previous x-bits was even
  or odd.  In other words, we might add an even parity bit for every
  8 bits of data.  If the parity bit is 1 then there was an even number
  of bits in the 8 bit stream, otherwise the number of bits was odd.
  As you might guess, this method only has limited value in detecting
  errors since a 2 bit error (2 bits are incorrect) might still produce
  the correct parity bit even though the message was errored.

<h3>Checksum</h3>
  The second method we will look at is called a checksum.  This is a
  simple computation of adding together all bytes in the data stream for
  a resulting sum that consists only of a byte.  If the sum exceeds the
  size of a byte then only the lower 8 bits are kept for the sum.  This
  method can detect more errors than just a parity bit and it is very
  simple to implement.  However, it is not nearly as robust as the final
  method we will discuss.

<h3>CRC</h3>
  The last method we will study is the Cyclic Redundancy Code (CRC).  This
  is the method most often used in practice.  It can be quickly computed
  and can detect most instances of errored messages.

<h4>Theory</h4>
  The basic idea behind the CRC is to use a known polynomial which is used
  to divide the bit stream.  Both sides of the communication (sender and
  receiver) must use the same polynomial in the calculation.  The frame
  to be sent is divided by the polynomial and the remainder is appended to
  the outgoing message.  Let the generator polynomial be G(x), and the
  frame to be sent be T(x).  Enough 0 bits are appended to T(x) before
  dividing so that the last bit in the message can be divided by G(x).  This
  is equal to 1 bit less than the number of bits in G(x).  
  After the division the
  remainder is subtracted from the bit stream with the appended 0 bits.
  It should be noted that the transmitted frame must be at least as large
  as the generator polynomial, otherwise the remainder is the transmitted
  frame.
<p>
  Upon receiving the message the same polynomial is used to divide the
  transmitted message.  If the result is 0, then the message had no
  errors.  To make more sense of this lets look at a case in decimal.
  If the message to send is 798, and the generator polynomial is 13, what
  would happen? <br>
<p>
  First we append the message: 798 -> 7980<br>
  Then divide: 7980/13 = 613 R 11<br>
  We subtract the remainder: 7980 - 11 = 7969<br>
  The message is transmitted: 7969<br>
  The receiver divides: 7969/13 = 613 R 0<br>
  The remainder is 0 so there was NO Error.<br>
<p>
  More generally we have T(x), G(x), M(x), and R(x) where M(x) is the
  actual message transmitted and R(x) is the remainder.<br>
<p>
  Transmitter:<br>
  R(x) = ( T(x) + 0's ) MOD G(x)<br>
  M(x) = ( T(x) + 0's ) - R(x)<br>
<p>
  Receiver:<br>
  R(x) = M(x) / G(x)<br>
  If R(x) = 0, then NO Error.<br>
<p>
  What kind of errors can this detect?  (Without detailing all of the theory
  why, the following errors will be found):<br>
<ul>
<li>All single bit errors.</li>
<li>Most double bit errors (depending on the polynomial).</li>
<li>All odd number of bit errors.</li>
<li>Errors with a burst length < r, where r = # bits in G(x).
</ul>

<h4>Implementation</h4>
 The two most important concepts we must know to calculate the CRC is what
  polynomial to use for the division, and how the division should work.  
<p>
  The polynomials that we will be using are international standards.  They
  generate 16-bit results and will catch 99.998% of all 18-bit error bursts.
  They are generally used on messages with 8-bit characters.  You should note
  that one requirement of all generator polynomials is that both the
  most significant and least significant bits must be 1.  The two
  polynomials are:
<center><table border=1>
<tr><td>Name</td> <td>Polynomial</td> <td>Bit representation</td></tr>
<tr><td>CRC-16</td> <td>x^16 + x^15 + x^2 + X^0</td>
    <td>11000000000000101</td</tr>
<tr><td>CRC-CCITT</td> <td>x^16 + x^12 + x^5 + x^0</td>
    <td>10001000000100001</td</tr>
</table></center>

<p>
  Division takes place by using polynomial arithmetic modulo 2.  What this
  means is that operations are performed at a binary level but there are
  NO carries for addition and NO borrows for subtraction.  If you do a couple
  examples you will see that both addition and subtraction can be thought
  of as an exclusive.  They are exactly the same, an XOR.

<tr><td align=right> 01110001</td><td></td>
    <td align=right> 01110001</td></tr>
</right></table></center>

  The rest of the division is exactly like performing long division in
  decimal except that we are working in base 2.  To tell if the divisor
  goes into part of the dividend you just look at the high bit, if it is
  a 1 then it goes in 1 time, if it is a 0 then it goes in 0 times.
<p>
  The easiest way to grasp the method is to look at an example.  For
  simplicity we will use 5-bit generator polynomial as the divisor and
  an 8-bit frame as the dividend.
<ul>
<li> Frame: 10110111 </li>
<li> Generator: 11001</li>
<li> Frame with appended bits: 101101110000</li>

<ul>
<li>The remainder: 1011</li>
<li>Transmitted Frame: 101101111011<br>
      (We subtracted the remainder = XOR)</li>
</ul>

  Now that we know how to do the division we just use our 17-bit polynomials
  and operate on the received frame by XORing bit by bit.  This is the method
  that you will use in your program.

<h4>Practical Implementation</h4>
  One final note regarding the implementation of CRC calculations in
  real programs.  Performing bit by bit shifting and XORing is much too
  expensive for computation on all incoming data.  This would involve at
  least one clock cycle of computation for each bit.  What is used instead
  is a lookup table for the CRC codes.  The incoming message is broken at
  the byte boundaries.  Each byte is used to access a table with 256 values.
  The resulting value is used to XOR into the final result.  The next byte
  is used to reference the table and the result XORed.  This helps eliminate
  a shifting and XORing loop for 7 of every 8 bits.  Once you have
  completed this MP you will more easily recognize the significant
  optimization that this provides.

<h2>Data Structures</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>A few variables have already been defined for you in the program
      framework.  <p>
     <ul>
     <li><b>TextMsg</b>: String of ASCII bytes holding raw text.<br>
          The end of this string should always be marked with 
          the NULL character.  <p>
     <li><b>Buffer</b>: An array of bytes that holds the
         encoded data. <br> 
         The first code begins with the least 
         significant bit (LSBit) of the first byte (Buffer[0]) in the array.
         The next code begins at the next bit location in the buffer.
         Note that the bit buffer may overlap multiple 
         byte locations.<p>
     <li><b>BufferLength</b>: A word which indicates how many
         bits are stored in the buffer.<p>
     </ul> <p>
   <li>A few constants have also been defined:<p>
     <ul>
     <li><b>TextMsgMaxLength</b> == 70 <i>bytes</i></b>,<br>
        i.e., Just less than one line of full-screen text.<p>
     <li><b>BufferMaxLengthBits</b> == TextMsgMaxLength * 8 + 16 <i>bits</i>,<br>
        i.e., The Text Message times 8-bits/character plus 2 bytes for the CRC.<p>
     <li><b>BufferMaxLength</b> == 1+(BufferMaxLengthBits/8) <i>bytes</i>,<br>
        i.e., Number of bytes required to hold Buffer, rounded up to next byte.<p>
     <li><b>CRC16</b> == 1000000000000101b<br>
        i.e., CRC-16 polynomial (without the high bit).<p>
     <li><b>CRCCCITT</b> == 0001000000100001b<br>
        i.e., CRC-CCITT polynomial (without the high bit).<p>
     <li><b>CRC</b> == 1010000000000001b (1000010000001000b)<br>
        i.e., CRC-16 (CRC-CCITT) polynomial reversed for easier division.<p>

  <li><b>Note</b>: An error message is generated if the division results
                   in a non-zero remainder.
  <li><b>Calls</b>: <i>Divide</i>
  <li><b>Points</b>: 5
  </ul><p>

<li><font size=+1><b>Divide</b></font>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose</b>: Performs a Polynomial Divide of the frame
                      by a generator polynomial<br>
                      (The frame is appended with 16 zero's for the divide)
  <li><b>Inputs</b>:
    <ul>
    <li>SI = Offset of buffer<br>
    <li>DX = Bits in buffer<br>
    <li>CRC = Generator Polynomial Constant
    </ul>
  <li><b>Output</b>: AX = Remainder from divide
  <li><b>Calls</b>: This function is called by <i>EncodeCRC</i> and <i>DecodeCRC</i>
  <li><b>Note</b>: An error message is generated if the size of the buffer
                   is too small to perform the division (&lt 16 bits)
  <li><b>Hints</b>: Divide from right to left using backwards CRC.
  <li><b>Points</b>: 10
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Preliminary Procedure</h2>
<ul>
<li>Copy the 
    empty MP2 program (<tt>MP2.ASM</tt>), 
    sample input file (<tt>test1.in</tt>),
    corresponding output files (<tt>test1.out</tt>),
    libraries (<tt>libmp2.lib</tt>, <tt>lib291.lib</tt>), and 
    <tt>Makefile</tt> from the network drive to your home directory
    with the following command: <br>
    <tt>xcopy /s V:\ece291\mp2 W:\mp2</tt><br>
    Alternatively, from home, you can download the same files as 
    <a href="mp2.zip">mp2.zip</a>.
<li>As with MP0 and MP1, run <tt>NMake</tt> to build an executable program 
    using the given ECE291 library functions.
<li>As with MP0 and MP1, use a text editor to modify the program.
    As given, the program uses LIBMP2 routines 
    to implement all
    functionality.  To receive full credit for the assignment,
    you will need to implement each of the subroutines described above with
    your own code.
<li>As with MP0 and MP1, use CodeView (<tt>CV</tt>) to debug and test your 
    program.
    Because you only receive credit for procedures that function completely
    as specified, it is best to debug each routine individually.  
<li>By modifying a few comments, you can mix and match usage of your 
    own code and Library routines.  You may notice that the LIBMP2
    routines contain extraneous and difficult-to-read code.  They 
    are not meant to be unassembled!
</ul>



<h2>Final Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Print a copy of the <a href="mp2grade.html">MP2 grading sheet</a>.
<li>Demonstrate MP2.EXE to a TA or to the instructor.  
  <ul>
   <li>Be prepared to answer questions about any aspect of the operation 
       of your program.  The TAs will not accept an MP if you cannot fully
       explain all operations of your code.
  <li>Your program must work for all possible data patterns.
      Additional test patterns will be listed on the grade sheet.
  <li>The TA will determine performance points using a sample message
  </ul>
<li>Handin in your program by running: <br>
    <tt>A:\Handin </tt> <i>YourWindowsLogin</i>
<li>Print <font color="red">MP2.ASM </font> using <i>GreenPrint32</i>
<li>Staple the MP2 grading sheet to the front of your MP2.ASM file
    and give both to the same TA that approved your demonstration.
</ol>
