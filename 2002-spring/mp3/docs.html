<h1 align="center">Machine Problem 3: Nybbles</h1>

<!-- <span class="update"><strong>Updates:</strong></span><br>

2/10 A new version of libmp2.lib is available that fixes the one character case
with KMP, and the search word being terminated by a '$' in the word grid.

<a name="io"><h2>Input and Output</h2></a>
<p>This MP will use primarily interrupt-driven I/O.&nbsp; This is what allows
our main function to be so simple, but it comes at a cost of increased debugging
complexity: you can almost never use the debugger to debug code within your
Interrupt Service Routine.&nbsp; For this reason among others, keep them as short as
possible. Then you can debug them by hand as needed.</p>
<h3>Interrupt Service Routines</h3>
<p>Hardware Interrupts are generated when various hardware events occur.&nbsp;
Examples include the timer, which triggers 18.2 times per second, the keyboard,
which triggers for every key press and release, the serial port, which depending
on the interrupt enable register, triggers each time the receive buffer is full,
and the mouse which triggers for any movement or button press or release. These
interrupts are the hardware's way of saying &quot;I need attention,&quot; so
that the rest of the time the CPU can completely ignore such devices, and just
execute code.</p>
<p>When the interrupt happens, the CPU is informed.&nbsp; The current opcode
finishes execution, and then the current program is interrupted. This is when
your interrupt service routine (ISR) is executed. As it happens between two
effectively random lines of your program, the ISR needs to save all registers
and the flags. The hardware takes care of part of this (by pushing of the
flags); the rest you must take care of by using IRET instead of RET (to pop the
flags), and saving your registers like normal.</p>
<h3>The Keyboard ISR</h3>
<p>When our keyboard handler is called, we know a key has been pressed or
released. Unfortunately, we don't know what key, whether it was pressed or
released, and whether the press is a true press or an auto-repeat press. There's
no way for us find out the last (except keeping track), but as for which key and
press or release, we can (and must) find this out by asking the keyboard for the
scancode. See section 10.1.2.2 of the&nbsp; lab manual for information on
retrieving these scancodes. The pages after that describe how scancodes work.</p>
<p>There are only a few keys that are important to Nybbles.&nbsp; These are the
arrow keys, and the escape key. You'll find constants for these declared at the
top to make working with them easier.</p>
<h3>Text-Mode Video</h3>
<p>We will be using memory mapped I/O.&nbsp; Which means that you will want to
move 0B800h into ES and explicitly make it your segment when writing to&nbsp;
the screen. e.g. [es:bx]. Remember that each character in text-mode video
has both an attribute and an ascii component.&nbsp; The size of the screen is
normally 80
by 25 characters, but we'll be using a mode that is 80x50 (just like 25 line
modes for addressing, but it has more available).&nbsp; Consult the lectures or homework 3 for more details
on how text-mode video works. Notice especially how to convert from a row and
column to an offset.</p>

<a name="logic"><h2>Game Logic</h2></a>
<p>After collecting the input, it needs to be tied together into into a cohesive
game. Since we need to enforce the rules of the game, here's some more detail
on what the rules are: </p>

<p>At each step, a worm must move forward, or turn 90 degrees and thus move left
or right. Since this happens according to a timer, there is a limited amount of
time for either the player or the AI to make a decision about what to do.
Furthermore, since entering an occupied map location causes the worm to lose,
there is some incentive for careful choices. Finally, the goal of the game is to
collect food represented by the numbers that appear on the screen. This in turn
increases difficulty, as the length of the worm increases with each item of
food it eats, decreasing the available space. </p>

<h3>Movement </h3>

<p>Movement is handled in three steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If the worm doesn't need to grow, delete the tail segment (logically and
    visibly)
    <ul>
      <li>If instead the worm does need to grow, increase the current size</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add the new head segment visibly</li>
  <li>Handle collisions at the new head: either extend the worm logically or report a loss</li>
</ol>
<h3>Collisions </h3>

<p>There are several types of collisions due to the four things a worm can
collide with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Nothing (0)
    <ul>
      <li>By far the most common case, and the simplest</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Food ('1' through '9')
    <ul>
      <li>This is good as it indicates the worm will need to grow. Just increase the
        growth size by SEGSIZE</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Wall (-1)
    <ul>
      <li>A worm who hits the wall loses</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Worm (one of the Worm.color values)
    <ul>
      <li>Similarly, a worm who hits a worm (itself or its opponent) loses</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You detect which of the above collisions it is by checking the map at the
head of the worm for one of the above parenthetical numbers. You can slightly
optimize this search by checking for an empty space, a number, or anything else.
Upon collision with a worm or the wall the winlose flag must be set. Set this to
1 if the player collided (the opponent wins), 2 if the opponent collided (the
player wins) or 3 for a mutual collision.</p>

<h3>Worm Data</h3>

<p>All of each worm's data is stored in a &quot;struc&quot; (structure).&nbsp;
This allows us to store the same kind of information in blocks and refer to the
entire block by a single address. Since both worm structures are structurally
the same, we can write a single function (e.g, MoveWorm) instead of a variant
for each player (e.g., MovePlayer, and MoveOpponent). To access the data in the
structure, use commands like the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>mov ax, [bx+Worm.size]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; sets ax to the size
  element of the Worm structure at offset bx</code></p>

</blockquote>
<p>In this example, Worm.size is a constant defined by the structure
declaration. Look at the structure declaration for more structure element names.

use the like in your submitted code.</p>

<p>The words in Worm.body are stored in a circular queue. The one with the
largest address is the head, and the one with the smallest address is the
tail.&nbsp; But not always. Since we can only declare a finite amount of space
in the array, once the head is in the largest spot available, the next location
it will take is the smallest. It will keep wrapping through this array as
necessary. What this means to your functions is that when you update the head or
tail pointers you must wrap at the maximum size (MAXLENGTH). Then you can place
your segment inside the array.&nbsp; It's a word composed of a low byte being
the row of your worm (y), and a high byte being the column (x).</p>

<a name="main"><h2>Main Function</h2></a>
<p>Each iteration of the main function needs to do the following things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Get the opponent's next move</li>
  <li>Wait for update to become non-zero</li>
  <li>Handle player's, then opponent's, movement</li>
  <li>Handle player's, then opponent's, collisions</li>
  <li>Set update back to zero</li>
</ul>
