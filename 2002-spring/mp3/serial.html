2/10 A new version of libmp2.lib is available that fixes the one character case
with KMP, and the search word being terminated by a '$' in the word grid.

<a name="main"><h2>Main Function</h2></a>
<p>Each iteration of the main function needs to do the following things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>wait for update to become non-zero</li>
  <li>if using the serial port
    <ul>
      <li>transmit local worm movement</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>handle player, then opponent, movement</li>
  <li>handle player, then opponent, collisions</li>
  <li>set update back to zero</li>
</ul>

<a name="io"><h2>Input and Output</h2></a>
<p>This MP will use primarily interrupt-driven I/O.&nbsp; This is what allows
our main function to be so simple, but it comes at a cost of increased debugging
complexity: you can almost never use the debugger to debug code within your
Interrupt Service Routine.&nbsp; For this reason, keep them as short as
possible, so you can debug them by hand as needed.</p>
<h3>Interrupt Service Routines</h3>
<p>Hardware Interrupts are generated when various hardware events occur.&nbsp;
Examples include the timer, which triggers 18.2 times per second, the keyboard,
which triggers for every key press and release, the serial port, which depending
on the interrupt enable register, triggers each time the receive buffer is full,
and the mouse which triggers for any movement or button press or release. These
interrupts are the hardware's way of saying &quot;I need attention,&quot; so
that the rest of the time the CPU can completely ignore such devices, and just
execute code.</p>
<p>When the interrupt happens, the CPU is informed.&nbsp; The current opcode
finishes execution, and then the current program is interrupted. This is when
your interrupt service routine (ISR) is executed. As it happens between two
effectively random lines of your program, the ISR needs to save all registers
and the flags. The hardware takes care of part of this (by pushing of the
flags); the rest you must take care of by using IRET instead of RET (to pop the
flags), and saving your registers like normal.</p>
<h3>The Keyboard ISR</h3>
<p>When our keyboard handler is called, we know a key has been pressed or
released. Unfortunately, we don't know what key, whether it was pressed or
released, and whether the press is a true press or an auto-repeat press. There's
no way for us find out the last (except keeping track), but as for which key and
press or release, we can (and must) find this out by asking the keyboard for the
scancode. See section 10.1.2.2 of the&nbsp; lab manual for information on
retrieving these scancodes. The pages after that describe how scancodes work.</p>
<p>There are only a few keys that are important to Nybbles.&nbsp; These are the
arrow keys, and the escape key. You'll find constants for these declared at the
top to make working with them easier.</p>
<h3>Text-Mode Video</h3>
<p>We will be using memory mapped I/O.&nbsp; Which means that you will want to
move 0B800h into ES and explicitly make it your segment when writing to&nbsp;
the screen. e.g. [es:bx].&nbsp; Remember that each character in text-mode video
has both an attribute and an ascii component.&nbsp; The size of the screen is 80
by 25 characters.&nbsp; Consult lecture eleven of this semester for more details
on how text-mode video works. Notice especially how to convert from a row and
column to an offset.</p>
<h3>Serial Communication</h3>
<p>Serial communication is handled by the hardware.&nbsp; The details of the
data transfer (which look worse than a memory timing diagram from ECE290) and
masked by a simple set of port I/Os (covered in section 10.1.2.2 of the lab
manual). However, since there are many choices (transfer speed, data parity,
etc.) that change the waveforms, these must be set prior to sending data across
the serial link.</p>
<p>There are two serial ports on each computer in the lab. Each work
identically, but are accessed at different I/O ports, and trigger different
interrupts. The exact numbers for these are conveniently declared as constants,
which provides meaning to what are otherwise arbitrary numbers. Each serial port
has several I/O ports associated with it, summarized in Table 1. To access any
of these ports, you must add the base port (either COM1BASE or COM2BASE) to the
offset port number, and put in in DX for use with the opcode IN or OUT. There is
one subtlety to accessing the registers on the serial port that these I/O ports
are mapped to: to conserve I/O ports, some I/O ports serve double duty depending
on the contents of another port.</p>

<font size="-1">Table 1: Serial Port Control Registers</font></center>
<p>What you need to do is the following:</p>
<h4>Set the Baud Rate</h4>
<p>We will be using 9600 BPS (BAUD). This requires a divisor of 12d (0Ch) to be
placed in the Divisor Latch. Remember to write this to the Divisor Latch Low
Byte register and to the Divisor Latch High Byte register separately; I/O ports
cannot be addressed sequentially in a single mov like memory can.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Divisor Latch registers are two of the registers that are
only available if the Divisor Latch Access Bit (DLAB) is 1.&nbsp; The DLAB is
the most significant bit of the Line Control Register (LCR), which you can set
by OUTing an appropriate value to COMBASE+3.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Set the Data Size</h4>
<p>FIXME: PARAMS?</p>
<h4>Unmask the IRQ</h4>
<p>Port 21h contains the IRQ mask for the master PIC. To enable an IRQ, you must
write a 0 to the corresponding bit.&nbsp; For example, to enable IRQs 0,1, and
2, while disabling all other IRQs, write the value 0F8h to port 21h. Rather than
just arbitrarily overwriting whatever mask is there, you should read the current
mask and then use logic opcodes to clear the bit for the desired IRQ.</p>
<h4>Set the IRQ Trigger</h4>
<p>FIXME : PARAMS?</p>
<p>The least significant bit of the Interrupt Enable Register (IER) tells the
serial port if it should generate a hardware interrupt whenever data is
received. Set it.</p>
<p>DLAB is just the most significant bit of the Line Control Register and can
thus be set or cleared rather easily simply by writing to port COMxBASE+3.&nbsp;
The least significant bit of the Interrupt Enable Register when set causes the
ISR to be jumped to only when the Receiver Buffer is full.&nbsp;</p>
