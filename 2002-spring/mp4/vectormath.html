<h1>Vector Math</h1>

<p>The core of this MP is learning to use SSE instructions in order to create
vector math functions.&nbsp; Here we'll introduce the formulae you'll be
implementing in this MP.&nbsp; First up though is describing the Vector, Point,
and Matrix STRUC's that you'll be working with in the MP.</p>

<h2>Vector STRUC</h2>
<p>The Vector STRUC declares a 4x1 vector, and it contains four components: x,
y, and z will represent the location of the point in <b>world</b> space, and a
homogeneous coordinate h is also declared.&nbsp; This coordinate is used to
simplify the number of calculations required to perform the same task had this
coordinate not be present.&nbsp; Each coordinate is a double word in size and
will hold floating point values.</p>

<h2>Point STRUC</h2>
<p>The Point STRUC contains three components: x and y will represent the
location of the point in <b>screen</b> space, and z will contain the depth of
the pixel to be checked against the Z-Buffer.&nbsp; Each coordinate is a word in
size and will hold integer values.</p>
<h2>Matrix STRUC</h2>
<p>The Matrix STRUC declares a 4x4 matrix.&nbsp; We will be using 4x4 matrices
instead of 3x3 matrices, even though we are in a 3D environment, because of
homogeneous coordinantes.&nbsp; Each location in the matrix is a double word in
size and will hold floating point values.</p>

<h2>Vector Normalization</h2>
<p>This operation returns a vector of length 1 in the same direction as the
input vector (which may have a length less than, greater than, or equal to
1).&nbsp; The formula to normalize a vector V is:</p>
<pre>V = 1 / sqrt(V.x^2 + V.y^2 + V.z^2) * V</pre>
<p>So, you multiply each component of the vector V by the scalar quantity above
to normalize it.&nbsp; This function is given to you and is heavily commented so
you can see the movement of the data between xmm registers.&nbsp; If a location
of a register contains xxxxxxx, that means I do not care about the value of the
data in this location.&nbsp; I highly suggest reading through this function to
get a better idea of how to write code with SSE instructions.</p>
<h2>Vector Cross Product</h2>
<p>The cross product operation involves calculating a vector that is perpendicular
to both input vectors.&nbsp; The formula is as follows:</p>
<pre>            |<b>x   y   z  </b>|
A x B = det |A.x A.y A.z| = (A.y * B.z - B.y * A.z)<b>x</b> - (A.x * B.z - B.x * A.z)<b>y</b> + (A.x * B.y - B.x * A.y)<b>z</b>
            |B.x B.y B.z|</pre>
<p>So, you create a 3x3 matrix, placing the three directions in the first row,
the components of vector A in the second row, and the components of vector B in
the third row.&nbsp; Notice that the homogeneous coordinate is not present -
remember it will only be used to hold temporary calculations and has no impact
on the direction of the vector.&nbsp; Thus, the <b>x</b> coordinate of the
result vector will be equal to A.y * B.z - B.y * A.z and so on.&nbsp; The value
of the homogeneous coordinate of the cross product vector should be 0.0.</p>
<h2>Multiplication of a Vector and a Matrix</h2>
<p>Multiplying a 4x4 matrix times a 4x1 vector will return a 4x1 vector.&nbsp;
We will be multiplying vectors with matrices in order to convert points from
world space to screen space.</p>
<pre>        [M11 M12 M13 M14]   [V.x]   [M11 * V.x + M12 * V.y + M13 * V.z + M14 * V.h]
M * V = [M21 M22 M23 M24] * [V.y] = [M21 * V.x + M22 * V.y + M23 * V.z + M24 * V.h]
        [M31 M32 M33 M34]   [V.z]   [M31 * V.x + M32 * V.y + M33 * V.z + M34 * V.h]
        [M41 M42 M43 M44]   [V.h]   [M41 * V.x + M42 * V.y + M43 * V.z + M44 * V.h]</pre>
<p>Thus, the <b>x </b>coordinate of the result vector is obtained by multiplying
the values in the first row of the matrix with the corresponding locations in
the vector (first with first, second with second, etc.) and then adding those
results together.&nbsp; The values of <b>y</b>, <b>z</b>, and <b>h</b> are also
obtained this way, the only difference is that they use matrix rows 2, 3, and 4
respectively.</p>
<h2>Camera Models and Camera Space</h2>
<p>Our camera will be modeled by three vectors: an Eye vector which will
determine the location of the camera in the world, a LookAt vector which
describes which direction the camera is pointing, and an Up vector which is a
measure of the camera's rotation about the z-axis.&nbsp; We will be using these
three vectors to create a camera matrix which will transform our points from
world space to camera space.&nbsp; In camera space, points are oriented as to
how the camera perceives them.&nbsp; For example, If I had a point at (10,0,0)
and the camera was at (0,0,0), the point would appear at (10,0,0) to the
camera.&nbsp; However, if I moved the camera to (5,0,0), the camera now sees the
point as being at (5,0,0).&nbsp; Since the camera was moved up 5 places, all
points in front of it are now 5 places closer.&nbsp; Similarly if we moved the
camera back 5 places to (-5,0,0), all points in front of the camera are now 5
places back.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Creating the Camera Matrix</h3>
<p>Here's how we construct our camera matrix:</p>
<pre>Let a = norm(LookAt - Eye)
Let b = norm(Up)</pre>
<p>Then</p>
<pre>c = a x b
b = c x a</pre>
<p>and the camera matrix contains the values:</p>
<pre>[ c.x  c.y  c.z 0.0]
[ b.x  b.y  b.x 0.0]
[-a.x -a.y -a.z 0.0]
[ 0.0  0.0  0.0 1.0]</pre>
<p>First, calculate the difference of the LookAt and Eye vectors and normalize
the result.&nbsp; Then normalize the up vector.&nbsp; Take the cross product of
those two vectors and store the result to a third vector.&nbsp; Then, take
another cross product which will make sure the Up vector (represented by <b>b </b>above)
is pointing in the correct direction.&nbsp; Lastly, fill the matrix with the
appropriate values, and you're done!</p>
<h3>Walking around the World</h3>
<p>The arrow keys on the keyboard let you walk forward, backward, right and left
in the world.&nbsp; Moving forward and backward are pretty straightforward, but
left and right movement takes a little more work.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Moving Forward<br>
    <br>
    To move forward, first calculate (LookAt - Eye) and save this temporary
    result.&nbsp; Then set the camera's Eye vector to the&nbsp; camera's LookAt
    vector.&nbsp; Finally, add the temporary (LookAt - Eye) value to the value
    of the LookAt vector.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Moving Backward<br>
    <br>
    To move backward, first calculate (LookAt - Eye) and save this temporary
    result.&nbsp; Then set the camera's LookAt vector to the&nbsp; camera's Eye
    vector.&nbsp; Finally, subtract the temporary (LookAt - Eye) value from the
    value of the Eye vector.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Moving Left<br>
    <br>
    To move left, we need to determine the vector perpendicular and to the left
    of the direction the camera is currently facing.&nbsp; So, first we'll have
    to calculate (LookAt - Eye) as before.&nbsp; Then, you'll have to take the
    cross product of this vector with the vector &lt;0,1,0&gt; and normalize the
    result.&nbsp; Finally, you'll have to add this value to both the LookAt and
    Eye vectors.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Moving Right<br>
    <br>
    To move right, we need to determine the vector perpendicular and to the
    right of the direction the camera is currently facing.&nbsp; So, first we'll
    have to calculate (LookAt - Eye) as before.&nbsp; Then, you'll have to take
    the cross product of this vector with the vector &lt;0,-1,0&gt; and
    normalize the result.&nbsp; Finally, you'll have to add this value to both
    the LookAt and Eye vectors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changing Camera Positions</h3>
<p>There are four default camera positions for the MP, and the mouse buttons let
you switch between them.&nbsp; The left mouse button will move to the next
camera position, and the right mouse button will return you to the location of
the current default position.&nbsp; The four positions are defined in the _CameraPositions
variable, and the current location is contained in the _CameraPos
variable.&nbsp; To return to the current position, copy the Eye, LookAt, and Up
vectors for the current camera position out of _Camera Positions and store them
to [_CameraEye], [_CameraLookAt], and [_CameraUp] respectively.&nbsp; To switch
camera positions, increment _CameraPos and then do the previously mentioned
action.&nbsp; If you are on the fourth camera position and you want to switch
positions, you should return to the first default position.</p>
<h2>Perspective Projection and Screen Space</h2>
<p>The closer an object is to your eye, the larger it appears to you and
vice-versa.&nbsp; Perspective projection is a projection model that takes this
into account.&nbsp; When a point is projected onto screen space, the locations
of the points on the screen, it will have an (x,y,z) value.&nbsp; The (x,y)
values denote its location on the screen, and the z value is the depth of the
pixel.&nbsp; To implement perspective projection, we multiply a vector
containing a point in camera space by the perspective projection matrix below:</p>

<pre>[0.75 0.0   0.0   0.0]
[0.0  1.0   0.0   0.0]
[0.0  0.0 -1.02 -2.02]
[0.0  0.0  -1.0   0.0]</pre>

<p>So, to convert a point from world space to screen space, you'll need to
follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a Translation matrix of the form:
<pre>[1.0 0.0 0.0 -CameraEye.x]
[0.0 1.0 0.0 -CameraEye.y]
[0.0 0.0 1.0 -CameraEye.z]
[0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ]</pre>

and multiply the vector containing the point by this matrix.&nbsp; This will
    move the camera to the origin.  An identity matrix has been declared for you,
and you can first copy this matrix to your translate matrix and then fill in the
negative eye coordinates.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Multiply the vector in (1) by the camera matrix to convert the point to
    camera space<br>
  </li>
  <li>Multiply the vector in (2) by the perspective projection
    matrix.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  </li>
  <li>After the multiplication in (3), the homogeneous coordinate of the vector
    will contain the depth information for the point.&nbsp;&nbsp; Divide each
    coordinate of the vector by the value of the homogeneous coordinate.&nbsp;
    The resulting vector will have the form:<pre>[V.x/V.h V.y/V.h V.z/V.h 1]</pre>
    This normalizes the coordinates to the range 1...-1 for x
and y and -1...1 for z.&nbsp; The reason why it is reversed for x and y is
because I am taking the +z direction to go into the screen, but the convention
is for the -z direction to go into the screen.&nbsp; However, our coordinates
for x, y, and z range from 0-639, 0-479, and 0-65535 respectively.&nbsp; The
    next steps will convert the points from normalized screen space to our
    640x480 screen.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Multiply the vector in (4) by the vector: <pre>[-1.0 -1.0 1.0 1.0]</pre>This will cause all coordinates
      to be in the range -1...1.  This vector is given to you as [_NormalCoordsVector].<br>
 </li>
  <li>Add the vector in (5) to the vector: <pre>[1.0 1.0 1.0 0.0]</pre>This will
    shift the range for all coordinates from -1...1 to 0...2.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Multiply the vector in (6) by the vector: <pre>[319.5 239.5 32767.5 1.0]</pre>This will
    convert the x point into the range 0...639, the y point into the range
    0...479, and the z point into the range 0...65535.  This vector is given to you as [_ScreenScaleVector].<br>
  </li>
  <li>Convert the floating point values for each of the coordinates to integer
    values and store the results to a point structure
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
