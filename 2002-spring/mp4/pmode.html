<h1>Protected Mode</h1>
<p>Protected Mode is a powerful way of gaining access to as much memory as the
computer has to offer. With this power comes some limitations, and <a href="/ece291/books/labmanual/realprot-diff.html">differences</a>.
You are encouraged to read through the <a href="/ece291/books/labmanual/pmode-intro.html">protected
mode tutorial</a>.
For more about the development
environment (and how to install it at home), see <a href="/ece291/books/labmanual/djgpp.html">this
page</a> from the tutorial.</p>
<p>Be sure to read carefully through the preliminary procedure as some things
have changed from previous MPs.  The most important thing you'll notice is that
the debugger has changed; it's now called <b>cv32</b>, and you run it by typing
<tt>cv32 mp4</tt>.  F8 steps, F7 traces, Tab switches between the windows, and
Alt-H brings up a help screen detailing more functions.
<p>To help make the transition to protected mode easier, a large library has
been provided to you. The <a href="/ece291/books/labmanual/pmodelib-ref.html">documentation</a> for all the
library functions is online, and even the <em>entire</em> source code is
available on the <tt>V:</tt> drive at <tt>V:\ece291\pmodelib</tt>! Please notice that all functions the
library provides and some of the functions you will be writing for this MP
conform to the C calling convention. This means the arguments are passed on the
stack in reverse order, you are free to modify (without saving) eax, ebx, ecx,
and edx (this also means that you should not expect these registers to be
preserved when calling a library function), and the return value is in eax/ax/al
(depending on its size). <a href="/ece291/books/labmanual/pmodelib-intro-proc-invoke.html">A
few macros</a> have been provided to make coding C procedures easier.
<p>Also remember that you now have full usage of the <em>entire</em> Intel
instruction set, including all 32-bit registers and extended addressing modes.
This means that you are free to address with any register, and even have an
index register multiplied by a power of two, e.g.: mov eax, [edx+ecx*4+5]. You
can use this to your definite advantage when you need to multiply by 3, 5, or 9:
just look up the LEA instruction and think about the advanced addressing modes.
Don't forget that you can't access the high 16 bits of the 32 bit registers
directly, you either need to clear, shift, or load out of memory to set those
bits. Feel free to look at the library source code for ideas and examples of how
to use the extended registers and addressing modes!</p>

<p>To get a copy of the protected mode library for home use, download and unzip <a href="/ece291/resources/pmodelib.zip">pmodelib.zip</a>.</p>
