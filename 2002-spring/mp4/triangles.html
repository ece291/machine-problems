<h1>Drawing Filled Triangles by Drawing Lines (and lots of them)</h1>
<p>You'll be drawing filled triangles in this MP using a modified version of a
3D Bresenham's line algorithm.</p>
<h2>Bresenham Variable Structure</h2>
<p>This structure holds the variables to be used in running Bresenham's line
algorithm between to points.&nbsp; A description of each field is given below.</p>
<pre>x               = current x position on line
y               = current y position on line
z               = current z position on line
dx              = number of pixels in x-direction
dy              = number of pixels in y-direction
dz              = number of pixels in z-direction
xdiaginc        = the amount to add to x when error1 &gt;= 0
xnodiaginc      = the amount to add to x when error1 &lt; 0
ydiaginc        = the amount to add to y when error1 &gt;= 0 
ynodiaginc      = the amount to add to y when error1 &lt; 0
zdiaginc        = the amount to add to y when error2 &gt;= 0
error1          = error at each point of the algorithm for x,y directions
error1diaginc   = the amount to add to error1 when error1 &gt;= 0
error1nodiaginc = the amount to add to error1 when error1 &lt; 0
error2          = error at each point of the algorithm for z direction
error2diaginc   = the amount to add to error2 when error2 &gt;= 0
error2nodiaginc = the amount to add to error2 when error2 &lt; 0
length          = number of pixels to draw</pre>
<p>Now we need to give these fields some values.&nbsp; Here's the pseudocode to
do so:</p>
<pre>procedure CreateBresenham3D(PointA, PointB)
begin 
 dx = abs(PointB.x - PointA.x) 
 dy = abs(PointB.y - PointA.y)
 dz = abs(PointB.z - PointA.z)</pre>
<pre> if dx &gt;= dy then 
  begin 
   error1 = (2 * dy) - dx
   error1diaginc = 2 * (dy - dx)
   error1nodiaginc = 2 * dy
   error2 = (2 * dz) - dx
   error2diaginc = 2 * (dz - dx)
   error2nodiaginc = 2 * dz
   xdiaginc = sign(PointB.x - PointA.x)
   xnodiaginc = sign(PointB.x - PointA.x)
   ydiaginc = 0
   ynodiaginc = sign(PointB.y - PointA.y)
   length = dx + 1
  end 
 else 
  begin 
   error1 = (2 * dx) - dy
   error1diaginc = 2 * (dx - dy)
   error1nodiaginc = 2 * dx
   error2 = (2 * dz) - dy
   error2diaginc = 2 * (dz - dy)
   error2nodiaginc = 2 * dz
   xdiaginc = sign(PointB.x - PointA.x)
   xnodiaginc = 0
   ydiaginc = sign(PointB.y - PointA.y)
   ynodiaginc = sign(PointB.y - PointA.y)
   length = dy + 1
  end</pre>
<pre> x = PointA.x;
 y = PointA.y;
 z = PointA.z;
end</pre>
<p>Lucky for you, I've spared you from writing this function!&nbsp; It's about
150 lines or so, and <b>very annoying</b> to write, especially at 2 AM when the <b>add</b>
looks like <b>mov</b>.&nbsp; Yes this happened to me.&nbsp; Yes I spent over an
hour debugging it.&nbsp; You can thank me anytime.</p>
<h2>Drawing Lines</h2>
<p>After setting up the Bresenham variable structure above, we can run the
algorithm to draw a line between the two points.&nbsp; For <i>length</i> pixels,
draw the pixel at the current (x,y,z) location, and then calculate the location
of the next pixel.&nbsp; Enter more pseudocode:</p>
<pre>procedure CalcNextPoint(BresStruc) 
begin 
 if BresStruc.error1 &lt; 0 then
  begin 
   BresStruc.x += BresStruc.xnodiaginc;
   BresStruc.y += BresStruc.ynodiaginc;
   BresStruc.error1 += BresStruc.error1nodiaginc;
  end
 else
  begin
   BresStruc.error1 += error1diaginc;
   BresStruc.x += BresStruc.xdiaginc;
   BresStruc.y += BresStruc.ydiaginc;
  end
 end
 
 if BresStruc.error2 &lt; 0 then
  begin 
   BresStruc.error2 += BresStruc.error2nodiaginc;
  end
 else
  begin
   BresStruc.error2 += error2diaginc;
   BresStruc.z += BresStruc.zdiaginc;
  end
 end
end</pre>
<h2>Drawing Triangles</h2>
<p>Now that you can draw lines, drawing unfilled triangles shouldn't be much
harder.&nbsp; Just draw three lines to connect the three points.&nbsp; Drawing
filled triangles is a little bit more involved.&nbsp; To do this, we'll be using
Bresenham's line algorithm again.&nbsp; To fill the triangle, take two of its
three points and <b>follow the line</b> between them.&nbsp; For each point along
that line, we're going to <b>draw a line</b> to the third point of the
triangle.&nbsp; This code should look similar to your DrawLine() code.</p>
<p>But wait!&nbsp; This method doesn't work perfectly - there will be some
pixels in the triangle that do not get filled in.&nbsp; To fix this, replicate
the code for drawing a filled triangle three times, and switch the order of the
points as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Follow line from A to B, draw lines to C</li>
  <li>Follow line from C to A, draw lines to B</li>
  <li>Follow line from B to C, draw lines to A</li>
</ol>
<p>This will ensure that all the pixels in the triangle will get filled.&nbsp;
Yes this isn't the best way to go about filling a triangle, but after spending
the time getting this to work, I wasn't about to investigate an entirely new
method.</p>
