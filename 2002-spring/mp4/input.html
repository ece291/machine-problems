<h1>Handling User Input</h1>
<p>You'll be able to control the program with both the keyboard and the mouse.</p>
<h2>Keyboard</h2>
<p>After MP3, keyboard ISRs should be no problem for you now.&nbsp; In the
KeyboardISR(), you will need to update the movement flags in the _MPFlags variable according to the key
pressed. </p>
<h2><a name="mouse">Mouse</a></h2>
<p>Like the keyboard, you need procedures for installation, removal, and
handling the mouse data.
<p><strong>But!</strong></p>
<p>The mouse handler isn't truly a handler at all. It's a callback. A callback
is the best of both worlds: it gets called like a normal procedure, getting all
data in standard places instead of having to perform odd I/O to get it; yet it
is also called in interrupt fashion - only, and immediately, when data is
available.</p>
<p>Or to look at it slightly less positive way, it's still called from an
interrupt, so you have to be careful about what you call - particularly no DOS
interrupts.</p>
<p>Luckily for you, the library does have a function available that gets a
real-mode callback address for your protected mode callback: Get_RMCB. However,
you will still need to tell the mouse driver to call the callback, and where the
callback is.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use Get_RMCB to get a real-mode callback address for MouseCallback. Save
    the segment and offset in MouseSeg and MouseOff
  <li>Call the Mouse interrupt (33h), function 0Ch to have the mouse driver call
    your callback on left mouse button press and release and mouse movement</li>
</ul>
<p>Removing the mouse callback is a matter of reversing your steps.
<ul>
  <li>Again use the mouse interrupt, this time to tell the mouse not to call
    your callback - use segment:offset of 0000:0000 for &quot;no callback&quot;
  <li>Then, use Free_RMCB to release the real-mode callback</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you've got the callback installing and removing, what does your
actual callback have to do?&nbsp; When the user clicks either mouse button, update the
_MPFlags variable accordingly: a left mouse button press will switch the default
position of the camera, and a right mouse button press will return you to the
current default position. </p>
