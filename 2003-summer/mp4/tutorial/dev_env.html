<p>The development environment used for this tutorial and for the protected mode 
MPs in ECE 291 is different from the one used for all of the other MPs. For this 
tutorial (and in the protected mode MPs and probably your final project), you 
will be using the DJGPP compiler system. The entire environment is installed 
under <tt class="FILENAME">V:\ece291\djgpp\</tt>. It's also available for 
download at
<a href="http://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece291/resources/djgpp.zip" target="_top">
http://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece291/resources/djgpp.zip</a> for those that want 
to install it at home.</p>

  About DJGPP</a></font></p>
  <p><a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/" target="_top">DJGPP</a> is a 
  complete 32-bit C/C++ development system for Intel 80386 (and higher) PCs 
  running DOS (or any version of Windows). It includes many of the standard GNU 
  development utilities (gcc, g++, gdb, etc) that are the de facto standard 
  tools available on most UNIXes, including Linux. The development tools require 
  a 80386 or newer computer to run, as do the programs they produce. In almost 
  all cases, the programs it produces can be sold commercially without license 
  or royalties.</div>

  <p class="SECT1"><font size="+2"><a name="Task 2: Beating the Simplest Program to Death">
  About DPMI</a></font></p>
  <p><b><i class="FIRSTTERM">DPMI</i></b> is the DOS Protected Mode Interface. 
  The programs produced by DJGPP run in 32-bit protected mode. The transition 
  from real-mode to protected-mode is provided by the DJGPP real-mode stub, 
  which calls DPMI. DPMI is also used by DJGPP programs to allocate memory, set 
  interrupt vectors, and perform protected-mode to real-mode (and vice-versa) 
  interrupt call translations.</p>
  <p>Why is DPMI necessary? Multitasking operating systems such as Windows 2000 
  run DOS programs within a <span class="QUOTE">&quot;virtual 8086&quot;</span> 
  environment, provided by 80386 and higher processors, that isolates the 
  operating system from program errors. However, this processor mode also 
  restricts access to certain features of the processor, such as the ability to 
  switch between real and protected mode. DPMI is a standardized interface that 
  provides interrupt-level functions for things such as switching between real 
  and protected mode, allocating memory, and setting interrupt vectors.</p>
  <p>If we were writing programs under a non-multitasking operating system such 
  as DOS, our programs would have complete control of the machine, as we 
  wouldn't be limited by the virtual 8086 mode. However, DPMI isn't available; 
  we'd have to implement all of its functionality by manipulating control 
  registers on the processor and building various data structures by hand. While 
  this would be an interesting (yet difficult) exercise, fortunately Charles 
  Sandmann has already done it for us by writing the CWSDPMI utility, a full 
  DPMI provider that runs on DOS.</p>
  <p>As we'll assume DPMI is the lowest level protected mode interface available 
  for our programs' use, we will learn about protected mode by first using these 
  functions directly. Later, we'll combine these low-level functions into 
  higher-level, easier-to-use library functions.</div>

  Setting Up DJGPP</a></font></p>
  <p>Normally setting up DJGPP requires the downloading of numerous (20+) ZIP 
  files and some minor configuration. However, a fully installed and configured 
  version of DJGPP is available on the lab machines. It should already be set up 
  and ready to use for this tutorial.</p>
  <p>If you want to develop at home, everything you need is in
  <a href="http://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece291/resources/djgpp.zip" target="_top">
  http://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece291/resources/djgpp.zip</a>. There are some 
  environment variables that need to be set properly in order for the tools to 
  work correctly:</p>
  <pre class="SCREEN">    SET PATH=C:\djgpp\bin;%PATH
    SET TMP=C:\temp
    SET TEMP=C:\temp
    SET DJGPP=C:\djgpp\djgpp.env
</pre>
  <p>A batch file, <tt class="COMMAND">djgpp.bat</tt>, is included in
  <tt class="FILENAME">djgpp.zip</tt> that sets these environment variables. It 
  is necessary to edit this file (to change the directory locations if 
  necessary) and run it in every DOS box you intend to use the DJGPP tools in. 
  If this gets tiring, you might try setting these variables in the Environment 
  Settings dialog box, accessed from the System Control Panel, Advanced tab (in 
  Windows 2000).</div>

    </li>
    <li>Go into the directory and type <tt class="COMMAND">nasm -f coff 
    basic.asm -l basic.lst</tt>. A quick run of <tt class="COMMAND">nasm -hf</tt> 
    shows that this assembles the <tt class="FILENAME">basic.asm</tt> file and 
    creates <tt class="FILENAME">basic.o</tt> in the form of a COFF object file. 
    (This is the format that the DJGPP linker can read). The object file 
    contains the assembled code and data and information about the variable and 
    label names so that the linker can link the object file with other object 
    files and the system libraries. NASM also creates a list file called
    <tt class="FILENAME">basic.lst</tt> which contains the compiled code with 
    line numbers, addresses, and data tacked on to it. Look at this file. <a href="questions.html#Question2">Question
2:</a>&nbsp; What is the opcode for ret?&nbsp; How many bytes were the two 
    opcodes in the _main function? Note how large the constant
    <span class="QUOTE">&quot;42&quot;</span> is.</li>
    <li>Type <tt class="COMMAND">objdump --disassemble-all basic.o</tt> to 
    disassemble the object file that NASM created and print its contents to the 
    screen. (This step doesn't actually do anything, it's just to see how NASM 
    works.) Look at the <tt class="COMMAND">objdump</tt> output. This is the 
    information that's in an object file. <a href="questions.html#Question3">Question 3:</a>&nbsp; 
    How much of the mov opcode was actually opcode and how much data? Hint: find 
    the hex value of your data in the opcode.</li>
    <li>Type <tt class="COMMAND">gcc -o basic basic.o</tt> which runs gcc, which 
    runs the linker to take the <tt class="FILENAME">basic.o</tt> file and link 
    it with the DJGPP startup code to make it an executable.<p>A <b>
    <i class="FIRSTTERM">linker</i></b> takes a bunch of assembled object files 
    and sticks them all into one big object (probably executable) file. Object 
    files can call routines or access variables in other object files as long as 
    they are declared <tt class="LITERAL">GLOBAL</tt> in one object file and
    <tt class="LITERAL">EXTERN</tt> in the others. When something is declared as
    <tt class="LITERAL">GLOBAL</tt>, NASM will put its name and address into the 
    object file it creates. Other object files, with <tt class="LITERAL">EXTERN</tt> 
    references to a routine or variable, will be assembled into object files 
    with unresolved links. The linker takes these object files, matches up the 
    names, and puts the the address of the <tt class="LITERAL">GLOBAL</tt> 
    routine or variable into the code instead of just an unresolved name. This 
    is how the LIB291 library code has been matched up with the MP code since 
    the beginning of the class.</li>
    <li>Type &quot;objdump --disassemble-all basic &gt; out.txt&quot; and look at out.txt 
    (which is now huge) to see the dump of the object file it created with all 
    the libraries. Find <tt class="LITERAL">&lt;_qsort&gt;</tt>. Find
    <tt class="LITERAL">&lt;start&gt;</tt> and <tt class="LITERAL">&lt;exit&gt;</tt>.
    <tt class="LITERAL">&lt;start&gt;</tt> is where protected mode execution actually 
    starts. It eventually calls your <tt class="LITERAL">&lt;_main&gt;</tt>. When
    <tt class="LITERAL">&lt;_main&gt;</tt> returns, execution passes into the
    <tt class="LITERAL">&lt;exit&gt;</tt> code which calls the <tt class="LITERAL">
    &lt;_exit&gt;</tt> code which calls the <tt class="LITERAL">&lt;__exit&gt;</tt> code, 
    which finally leaves protected mode. This is how C works. Be afraid. Be very 
    afraid.</li>
    <li>Type <tt class="COMMAND">basic</tt> to run the example program. Nothing 
    happened? Good. Awe at the fact that there's only one line of assembly, yet 
    twenty million things had to go on to get into and out of protected mode, to 
    load the code, to interact with the operating system, to toggle the bits in 
    the microprocessor, to manipulate the quantum state of billions and billions 
    of electrons, etc, etc...<p>If it seems like an excessive amount of work for 
    one line of code, it is. It's possible to do the exact same thing this
    <span class="QUOTE">&quot;basic&quot;</span> program did in real mode. Keep in mind 
    that this is only the beginning, and it's good to start simple.</li>
    <li>Type <tt class="COMMAND">cv32 basic</tt> to actually see what's going 
    on. This is the best protected mode debugger available in ECE 291 at the 
    moment. Hit <b class="KEYCAP">F8</b> a few times to step through. (Go slow, 
    or it's easy to miss the one line of code!) <b class="KEYCAP">Alt</b>-<b class="KEYCAP">H</b> 
    brings up a help screen. <b class="KEYCAP">Alt</b>-<b class="KEYCAP">X</b> 
    exits. CV32 will become more useful as the programs get more complex.</li>

<P>The startup of a DJGPP protected-mode program is far more complex than a real-mode 
program.  First, DOS reads in the real-mode stub and executes it.  This real-mode stub checks to
see if DPMI is available, and then uses it to switch to
protected mode.  After switching to protected mode, it then asks the operating
system to allocate memory for the program's
code and data segments, loads the protected mode image from disk, and then directs processor
execution into the DJGPP library startup code. This startup code does some dirty work such as reading
the command line and initializing the standard library, and then runs your <b><samp>_main</samp></b>.
