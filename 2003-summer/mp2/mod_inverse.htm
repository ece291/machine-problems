<title>Multiplicative Inverse Modulo X</title>

<p>Multiplicative Inverse Modulo X (a quick and dirty definition)</p>
<p>First you need to understand what modulo (mod) is.&nbsp; The modulus simply 
the remainder of a division of two integers.&nbsp; For example, if you divide 11 
by 2, you get the quotient of 5 with a remainder of 1.&nbsp; Put in terms of 
modulus, 11 mod 2 = 1.&nbsp; With modulus the quotient of the division doesn't 
really matter, just the remainder..</p>
<p>In algebra every number has an inverse.&nbsp; For example, the inverse of 2 
is 1/2 or the inverse of 1/5 is 5.&nbsp; Another way of defining an inverses 
could be that a number multiplied by its inverse is equal to 1.&nbsp; For 
example 2*1/2 = 1 or 1/5*5. </p>
<p>Suppose you had the following (A*B) mod X = 1,&nbsp; in this equation A and B 
would be multiplicative inverses modulo X of each other.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example&nbsp; 
(2*5) mod 9 = 1,&nbsp; 2 is the multiplicative inverses modulo 9 of 5,&nbsp; and 
5 is the multiplicative inverses modulo 9 of 2.&nbsp; Just to drive in the 
point..</p>
<p>3*7 = 21&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; 21 mod 5 = 1&nbsp;&nbsp; so&nbsp; (3*7) mod 5 
= 1&nbsp;&nbsp; therefore 3 and&nbsp; 7 are multiplicative inverses modulo 5 of 
each other.</p>
<p>For the Keys function mp2 you are given K1 and K2 in the equation (K1 *&nbsp; 
InvK1) mod K2 = 1.&nbsp; What you need to do is find InvK1. </p>
