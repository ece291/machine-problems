<h2>Introduction</h2>

Human game players are quickly falling prey to their faster and smarter
computerized counterparts.  In the game of Chess, for example, 
IBM's Deep Blue has already beaten the word champion Gary Kasparov.
Soon, no human game will be sacred.
<p>
For this machine problem, you will write the algorithm to 
automate the game of 'Word Find'.  This type of game, typically found in 
newspaper or a TV guide, requires locating words in a matrix of letters.
Words may appear in any direction, and (for this game) may even wrap
around the edges.
<p>
Your code, if written properly, should be able to locate a word
in such a game in a sub-millisecond, and thus easily beat any human
player.  As an optimized assembly-language program, the fastests
program written for this class will become known as 'Deep 291'.




<h2>Algorithm Description</h2>
In the main procedure of the code, the program scans the original
matrix of letters <CODE>(OrigMatrix)</CODE> for the first letter
of the word that you specify.  Once a matching first letter is
found, calls are made to check the entire word in all four directions
(right, down, left, and up).  When an entire word is found that matches,
the <code>replace</code> routine is called to copy that word from
<code>OrigMatrix</code> to <code>EndMatrix</code>.  The 
<code>PrintMatrix</code> routine is called to print the resulting
<code>EndMatrix</code> after all searches have completed.

<h2>Program Operation</h2>
<p>The word to search for is entered on the command line.  
If you want to search for ECE291, for example, type <code>MP1 ECE291</code>.  
A sample run from the program is shown below:

<p>
Run the program a few times to learn how it operates.
Try searching for other words like:
'BINARY', 'NIBBLE', 'SEGMENT', 'VIDEO', 'REGISTER', and
the number '9'   (case matters).
Note that words my wrap around the matrix.  Also note that
multiple words are found if they appear more than once.
<p>
Next, look through the given source code and rebuild
the executable from source code by typing 
<code>NMAKE CLEAN</code> then <code>NMAKE</code>.
Now run 
the program under CodeView.  Choose your search word 
by a click to open the (R)un menu then (S)et Runtime Arguments.
Step through the code
as you did in MP1.  Use the function keys to trace (F8) through
your code, step (F10) over library calls, and go (F5) between breakpoints.
Review MP0 if you need help with CodeView.

<h2>Variables</h2>

Several variables and constants have already
been defined for this program.  Your code should use these
variables, as well as any others that you decide to create.<p>

<ul>
<li><b>OrigMatrix</b><br>
The matrix to search through.  This array of bytes is defined in the 
<i>WORDFILE.ASM</i> file.
Note that the data is stored sequentially in memory, starting 
with the first row of bytes.
<p>

<li><b>NumRows</b><br>
A constant defined in the <i>WORDFILE.ASM</i> file that specifies the number of rows in the matrices.<p>

<li><b>NumCols</b><br>
A constant defined in the <i>WORDFILE.ASM</i> file that specifies the number of columns in the matrices.<p>

<li><b>EndMatrix</b><br>
The final result of the program.  
This is another array of bytes equal in size to <b>OrigMatrix</b>.
<b>EndMatrix</b> is initialized to dots ('.') 
and is overwritten with letters when words are found.<p>

<li><b>offsetPos</b><br>
The current offset of the letter we are checking in the matrix.  This variable is used by
<b>CheckLetter</b> each time it compares the first letter of the 
word to a letter in <b>OrigMatrix</b>.  Note that the initial value of
offsetPos is zero, which is not necessarily
the memory location of the variable itself.<p>

<li><b>RowPos</b><br>
The current row of the letter we are checking in the matrix.  Use this variable for bounds
checking.<p>

<li><b>ColPos</b><br>
The current column of the letter we are checking in the matrix.  Use this variable for bounds
checking.<p>
</ul>

<h2>Procedures</h2>

<p>This assignment has eighteen procedures. 
You will receive credit by replacing each of these
eighteen procedures listed below with your own code. 

<ul>


  <li><strong><big>CheckLetter</big></strong><ul>

          <li>The first letter of the command line argument 
              (which is located at <tt>ES:[82h]</tt>) </li>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>Preliminary Procedure</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Copy the empty MP1 program (<tt>MP1.ASM)</tt>), 
      the data file (<tt>WORDFILE.ASM</tt>),
      libraries (<tt>libmp1.lib</tt> and <tt>lib291.lib</tt>), 
      and the <tt>Makefile</tt> from the network drive to your home 
      directory with the following command: <br>
     <tt>xcopy /S V:\ece291\mp1 W:\mp1</tt><br>
    <i>(Note that the '/S' must be in CAPS, not lower case)</i><br>
    Alternatively, from home you can download the same 
    files as <a href="mp1.zip">mp1.zip</a>.
  </li>
  <li>As with MP0, run <tt>NMake</tt> to build an 
   executable program using the given ECE291 library functions. </li>
  <li>As with MP0, use a text editor to modify the program. 
    As given, the program uses LIBMP1 routines to implement all functionality. 
    To receive credit for the assignment, you must replace 
    all of the subroutines described above with your own code. </li>

  <li>As with MP0, use CodeView (<tt>CV</tt>) to 
     debug and test your program. Because you only receive 
     credit for procedures that functions entirely as specified
    (and with all possible types of input), 
     it is best to debug each routine individually.  
    You not earn <i>any</i> points by coding only part of a subroutine.
</ul>

<h2>Hints</h2>
<ul>
<li>The LIBMP1 file contains executable library functions for 
    each of the routines that you need to implement.  
    This allows you to run the program and understand how it works before you 
    implment it.  You can test your program with any combinations 
    of your own code and library functions.  You will only receive credit, 
    however, for the routines that you implement yourself. 

<li>Be sure to use CodeView to help debug the operation of your
    program.  Review MP0 if needed.

<li>When referring to memory locations, use
    symbolic names rather than a numeric address values.

<li>If you feel that you are repeating code, then STOP.
    Using modular procedures, you should be able to elimate 
    most of the redundant code in your program.  
    This is most important for the routines
    Check{Right,Down,Left,Up} and Replace{Right,Down,Left,Up}.
    The shorter your code, the better!

<li>START EARLY!  This is the first MP that requires you 
    to write your own program.  Composition is much mork difficult 
    than comprehension.  

<li>Monitor the <a href="news:uiuc.class.ece291">newsgroup</a> 
    for clarifications and help.
</ul>

<h2>Final Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Print a copy of the MP1 grading report (MP1GR).
      Double-check that your program is ready for demonstration
      <i>before</i> you ask a TA to grade it.
  <li>Demonstrate your MP1.EXE to a TA or to the instructor. 
     You will then be asked to recompile and demonstrate MP1 
     with different word files and search terms. 
    Your program must work with all given
    input. </li>
  <li>Be prepared to answer questions about any aspect of the 
    operation of your program. The
    TAs will not accept an MP if you cannot fully explain 
    the operation of your code
    and details of your implementation. 
    Delayed MPs will be subject to late penalties.</li>
  <li>Print MP1.ASM 
  <li>Take your printout and disk with MP1 to the same TA which approved your demonstration.
    Staple the grading sheet to the front of the MP1.ASM prinout.  Be sure that your name is appears
    in your code and on the grading sheet.
