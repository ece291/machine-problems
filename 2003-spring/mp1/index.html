<H2>Introduction</H2>Hangman is a simple word-guessing game. 
Implementing a basic hangman game in assembly will introduce you to the basics 
of writing assembly code, as well as preparing you to write more complicated 
programs in later MPs. 
<H2>Problem Description</H2>
<P>In Hangman, the user is presented with an unknown word, consisting of all 
underscore ('_') characters. The object of the game is to guess every letter in 
the word. However, each time the user guesses a letter that is not in the word, 
part of the hangman is drawn to the gallows. If the entire hangman is drawn to 
the gallows (head, left arm, right arm, left leg, and right leg), the user loses 
and the hangman is hung. If the user can guess all of the letters in the word 
while making fewer than 5 wrong guesses, the user wins. </P>
<P>In our implementation of Hangman, there are a few key issues and variables: 
<UL>
  <LI><B>Strings</B><BR>In assembly, strings are just a series of bytes of ASCII 
  characters. The lib291 string-display function, <tt><b>dspmsg</b></tt>, uses a '$' character to mark 
  the end of a string. For example, the string 'ECE291$' would be a seven-byte 
  string - one byte each for 'E', 'C', 'E', '2', '9', '1', and the end-of-string 
  character '$'. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>The <TT>WordSpace</TT> and <TT>TheWord</TT> 
  variables</B><BR><TT>TheWord</TT> is a string variable storing the word that 
  the user is trying to guess. For simplicity, it is a static variable - the 
  word will not change each time you run the program. If you want to use a 
  different word than the default, you may change the word in your source .asm 
  file, but make sure to keep it under 20 characters. <TT>WordSpace</TT> is a 
  20-byte string for you to store your 'word-in-progress'. In the Init function, 
  you should set up <TT>WordSpace</TT> to have as many underscore characters as 
  <TT>TheWord</TT> has letters. As the user correctly guesses letters, these 
  letters will replace the underscores in <TT>WordSpace</TT>. 
  <P></P>
  <LI><B>The <TT>UsedLetters</TT> array</B><BR>To keep track of which letters 
  have already been guessed, we will use a 26-byte array called 
  <TT>UsedLetters</TT>. Each byte-sized element of this array corresponds to a 
  letter in the alphabet - element 0 corresponds to 'a', 1 corresponds to 'b', 
  and so on. Each byte acts as a flag: if the byte corresponding to a letter is 
  a 0, that letter has not been guessed. If the byte is a 1, that letter has 
  been used. </LI></UL>

<H2>MP1 Program Assignment</H2>
<P>In this machine problem, the main procedure and the procedure to draw the 
hangman (<tt><b>DisplayGallows</b></tt>) are provided for you; however, you must write the 
code to replace the other library routines. You will replace these procedures 
from the LIBMP1 library by commenting out the statements calling the Lib routine 
and adding your code. Each routine that you write should match the output of the 
library code exactly. Each of the function calls and their functionality is 
described below in the <b>Subroutines</b> section. The best way to get a feel 
for the program is to run it to see how it is supposed to operate.</P>
<P>Your program is required to: 
<OL type=I>
  <LI>Process each character that the user guesses appropriately 
  <LI>Display the word-in-progress and list of already-guessed letters correctly 

  <LI>Determine whether the user has won or lost 
  <LI>Run efficiently. Points will be deducted for inefficient algorithms and/or 
  excessive coding. </LI></OL>
<P>The program can be run by typing <TT>mp1</TT> at the command prompt. </P>
<H2>Brief Intro to PUSH and POP</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>Pushing and poping are stack operations and will be covered later in 
  lecture. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>PUSHA will record onto the stack a copy of the data in all of the CPU's 
  registers. POPA removes the data from the stack and copies it back to the 
  registers. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Pushing and popping is, among other things,&nbsp;used to ensure that a 
  called function doesn't scramble registers that&nbsp;the calling function 
  uses. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>You can push and pop individual registers with instructions like <TT>push 
  ax</TT> and <TT>pop cx</TT>. PUSHA and POPA save <I>all</I> of the registers 
  to the stack.  Pushing and popping individual registers is the 
  preferred method of saving/restoring register data when calling a function. 
  PUSHA and POPA are used here for simplicity. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>Precocious students will examine <A

  6</A> or <A

  Lecture</A>. </LI></UL>
<H2>Hints</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>The LIBMP1 file contains executable library functions for each of the 
  routines that you need to implement. This allows you to run the program and 
  understand how it works before you implement it. You can test your program 
  with any combinations of your own code and library functions. You will only 
  receive credit, however, for the routines that you implement yourself.
  <P></P>
  <li>The <tt><B>DisplayGallows</B></tt> function has been written for you.  You
  can use it as a model to see how to write and comment your own assembly functions.
  <p></p>
  <li>Check out
  <a href="http://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece291/books/labmanual/libraries.html">Chapter 9</a>
  in your lab manual for descriptions and documentation for the lib291 functions
  <tt><b>dspout</b></tt> and <tt><b>dspmsg</b></tt>.  These functions are used for displaying a character
  and a string to the screen, respectively.
  <p></p>
  <LI>You may define new variables as needed.
  <P></P>
  <LI>START EARLY! This is the first MP that requires you to write your own 
  program. Composition is much more difficult than comprehension.
  <P></P>
  <P></P>
  <LI>Monitor the <A href="news:uiuc.class.ece291">newsgroup</A> for 
  clarifications and help.
  <P></P></LI></UL>
<H2>Subroutines</H2>
<P>This assignment has five procedures. You will receive credit by replacing each 
of these five procedures listed below with your own code. </P>
<P>Document your functions with descriptive function headers.&nbsp; Look in your 
lab book for examples or ask a TA.&nbsp; YOU WILL LOSE POINTS IF YOU DON'T WRITE 
CLEAR, CONCISE FUNCTION HEADERS!!!!</P>

  </LI></UL>

<H2>Development Log and Cover Memo</H2>

<P>As you work on each machine problem, you will keep a simple MP 
development log. The log will document your design decisions, development plan,
and debugging experiences, including the time you spent on different parts
of the machine problem. The log may be kept in any form. In general, whenever
you work on a machine problem, briefly record the starting time, 
significant design decisions, progress in coding and
testing, bugs you discovered, and the ending time. Do <I>not</I> record
simple syntax errors detected by NASM at assembly time; these 
are not considered to be bugs.</P>

<P>For each machine problem, beginning with MP1, you will submit a cover memo of
200 to 400 words (up to one page, single spaced). The cover memo
should answer the following questions, based on the information that you
record in your MP development log. 
<UL>
<LI>How much time did you spend on the design, coding, and testing of each part 
or subroutine?</LI>
<LI>What kinds of defects (bugs) did you find during the development 
of the program? When did you discover these defects (during
code review or during testing)? How did you find them?</LI>
<LI>What you would do differently for the next MP?</LI>
</UL>
<p>Type your cover memo into a plain text file in your W:\mp1 directory </p>
<H2>Final Steps</H2>
<OL>
  <LI>Demonstrate your MP1.EXE to a TA or to the instructor.&nbsp; The TA or 
  instructor will verify that your program works as intended. 
  <LI>Be prepared to answer questions about any aspect of the operation of your 
  program. The TAs will not accept an MP if you cannot fully explain the 
  operation of your code and details of your implementation. Delayed MPs will be 
  subject to late penalties as described in the course syllabus (10%/day). 
  <LI>The TA will handin your MP online. </LI></OL>
