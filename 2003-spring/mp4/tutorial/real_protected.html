  <h1 class="SECT1"><a name="REALPROT-DIFF-SOURCE">Source Differences</a></h1>
  <p>Up to this point in ECE 291, the MP's have been written in real mode, with 
  a source design that reflects real mode assumptions. When writing code for 
  protected mode, the source organization will change, but only slightly. The 
  primary differences are:</p>
  <div class="SECT2">
    <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="REALPROT-DIFF-SOURCE-SECTION">
    <tt class="LITERAL">SEGMENT</tt> is Now <tt class="LITERAL">SECTION</tt></a></h2>
    <p>In protected mode, <tt class="LITERAL">SEGMENT</tt> would be a bit of a 
    misnomer, as while segment registers are still used to address memory, they 
    hold selectors instead of segments (see
    <a href="tmp/realprot-diff-memory.html#REALPROT-DIFF-MEMORY-SEGMENTS">
    Section 17.2.3</a> for more information about this). In NASM,
    <tt class="LITERAL">SEGMENT</tt> and <tt class="LITERAL">SECTION</tt> are 
    treated identically internally, so this is just a semantic change, not a 
    functional one.</div>
  <div class="SECT2">
    <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="REALPROT-DIFF-SOURCE-STACK">No
    <tt class="LITERAL">STACK</tt> Segment</a></h2>
    <p>Unlike the real mode MPs, the DJGPP platform used for writing protected 
    mode code in ECE 291 provides a stack, so there's no need for the assembly 
    source to provide one.</div>
  <div class="SECT2">

    <p>As the assembly program is linked to the DJGPP startup code also means 
    the program execution doesn't begin at the <tt class="LITERAL">..start</tt> 
    label as it did in real mode, but at the C-style function
    <tt class="FUNCTION">_main</tt>.</p>

    <p>This change is a conceptually major one: the addition of an
    <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">uninitialized</i></span> data 
    segment. What does this mean? All data variables declared in the
    <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">initialized</i></span> data 
    section take up space in the executable image on disk. This data is then 
    copied into memory when the program is run, along with the program code. 
    Data placed in the uninitialized section, on the other hand, does not take 
    up space on disk. When the program is run, extra space is tacked onto the 
    end of the data segment (accessed with <tt class="REGISTER">DS</tt>) and 
    initialized to 0.</p>
    <p>There are uninitialized equivalents to the <tt class="LITERAL">db</tt>,
    <tt class="LITERAL">dw</tt>, etc. family of data declarations that start 
    with <span class="QUOTE">&quot;<tt class="LITERAL">res</tt>&quot;</span> (reserve) 
    instead of <span class="QUOTE">&quot;<tt class="LITERAL">d</tt>&quot;</span> 
    (declare), e.g. <tt class="LITERAL">resb</tt>, <tt class="LITERAL">resw</tt>, 
    etc. These <span class="QUOTE">&quot;reserve&quot;</span> equivalents just take a 
    single number: the number of data items of this size to reserve space for. 
    Within the <tt class="LITERAL">.bss</tt> section, these equivalents must be 
    used instead of <tt class="LITERAL">db</tt> and the like.</p>
    <p>Use the <tt class="LITERAL">.bss</tt> section instead of the
    <tt class="LITERAL">.data</tt> section for variables that can be 0 at 
    program startup. Remember that the <span class="QUOTE">&quot;<tt class="LITERAL">res</tt>&quot;</span> 
    family takes the <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">number</i></span> 
    of items, so:</p>
    <pre class="PROGRAMLISTING">SECTION .data

a db 0

    <p>If you have a picture in your head of how segments work in real mode, 
    great. If you know about how to calculate a linear address by multiplying 
    the segment by 16 and adding the offset, great. You'll need this for the 
    exam. You won't need this for protected mode. The segment registers in 
    protected mode are now the selector registers. A <b><i class="FIRSTTERM">
    selector</i></b> is an index into a descriptor table. In the case of a 
    single application program, it's an index into the Local Descriptor Table (LDT). 
    The LDT is a table of (not suprisingly) <b><i class="FIRSTTERM">descriptors</i></b>. 
    Descriptors hold information about a sub-region of the 4 Gigabyte 32-bit 
    physical address space. The reason we need this table is because in 
    protected mode, not every segment is the same size. Enough of theory; time 
    to look at how this actually works, in the debugger.</p>

        <li>Look at the Code Selector (<tt class="REGISTER">CS</tt>). Remember

        Scroll down to this offset in the Local Descriptor Table window.</li>
        <li>It should say that it is a code selector that is read only. It

        <li>Now look at the Default/Data Selector (<tt class="REGISTER">DS</tt>) 
        and its LDT entry.</li>
        <li>Looking at the LDT entry for <tt class="REGISTER">DS</tt>, it should 
        be 32-bit data which is both readable and writeable. It starts at the 
        same address and is the same size as the Code Selector, strangely 
        enough. Of course in the past MPs in ECE 291, we've set
        <tt class="REGISTER">DS</tt> to point to the same place as
        <tt class="REGISTER">CS</tt>. Note that the same thing is true here even

      <tt class="REGISTER">EAX</tt>, dword [<tt class="REGISTER">DS</tt>:<tt class="REGISTER">EBX</tt>]</tt>,

      <p>While the processor is doing this, it checks the offset against the 
      segment length in the LDT. If the offset is <span class="QUOTE">&quot;out of 
      range&quot;</span> when it preforms the check, the processor causes a General 
      Protection Fault and calls interrupt 13h. This interrupt goes to the 
      operating system which promptly terminates the program for trying to 
      access memory that it doesn't own. (This is one of the ways memory is 
      protected in protected mode). <span class="QUOTE">&quot;So why can't the 
      program just go into the Local Descriptor Table and give the segment a 
      huge length?&quot;</span> Programs are never allowed to deal with the Local 
      Descriptor Table directly. They must request additional memory from the 
      OS, and the OS changes the descriptor table. The OS also keeps track of 
      what programs have what memory and shuts down misbehaving programs.</p>
      <div class="TIP">
        <blockquote class="TIP">
          <p><b>Tip:</b> General Protection Faults are the primary cause of 
          program crashes when programming in protected mode. When a fault 
          occurs outside of a debugger, the program is terminated and 
          information is printed to the screen that shows all the registers, the 
          segments and their limits, and a stack trace. In a debugger, the 
          debugger halts the program, highlighting the line that caused the 
          error.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Once the processor has the linear address and has verified the offset 
      is correct, it looks in the processor's Virtual Memory Page Table to get 
      the physical address, which is what actually gets sent out on the bus. If 
      the Page table says that the particular page required is not in physical 
      memory, the processor causes a <span class="QUOTE">&quot;Page Fault&quot;</span> and 
      the operating system (in this case, Windows) will have to load it off of 
      disk. (This procedure is often called swapping). Note that there are a few 
      more levels of abstraction here than there were in real mode. ECE 291 
      doesn't cover Virtual Memory or swapping, so this paragraph really isn't 
      that important to programming in ECE 291, except for the following:</p>

<h1 class="SECT1"><a name="REALPROT-DIFF-INTERRUPTS">Using Interrupts in 
Protected Mode</a></h1>
<p>Suprisingly enough, calling interrupts in protected mode under DPMI is very 
similar to calling interrupts in real mode. Even though this isn't 16-bit DOS 
and DOS interrupt handlers are 16-bit code, most interrupt calls get mirrored 
automatically by DPMI from protected to real mode. However, there are many 
situations for which this automatic translation doesn't work. Keep reading for 
details!</p>
<div class="SECT2">
  <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="REALPROT-DIFF-INTERRUPTS-IDT">The Interrupt 
  Descriptor Table</a></h2>
  <p>Unlike in real mode, where the interrupt vector table is always at address 
  00000h, in protected mode, the Interrupt Descriptor Table can be anywhere in 
  memory and is protected by the processor and the OS. Also unlike the real-mode 
  interrupt vector table, the IDT stores additional information about the 
  various handlers, but it is essentially still a <span class="QUOTE">&quot;jump 
  table&quot;</span> indexed on the interrupt number.</div>
<div class="SECT2">
  <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="REALPROT-DIFF-INTERRUPTS-DPMI">Calling Interrupts 
  under DPMI</a></h2>
  <p>Under DPMI, the entries in the IDT point to DPMI's own interrupt service 
  routines. For most of these, DPMI is kind enough to just drop into real mode, 
  call the corresponding real-mode interrupt, and return to protected mode 
  before returning to the calling program. Pretty complicated, but DPMI handles 
  all these extra steps automatically.</p>
  <p>For interrupts that don't use segment registers, this automatic translation 
  works extremely well. Interrupts that have inputs or outputs in segment 
  registers, however, need to be called using a special DPMI function, because 
  the segment registers change when switching from protected to real mode and 
  back. Also, even if the segment registers didn't change, in protected mode 
  setting a segment register to a real-mode segment value will (usually) cause a 
  General Protection Fault, because the segment registers must hold a valid 
  selector value while in protected mode.
  <a href="http://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece291/resources/pmode/dpmi/api/310300.html" target="_top">
  DPMI function 0300h, &quot;Simulate Real Mode Interrupt,&quot;</a> allows the program to 
  set <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">all</i></span> registers that 
  can be read by the real-mode interrupt handler. After the interrupt returns, 
  the values of all the registers set by the real-mode interrupt handler can be 
  read back by the protected mode program.</div>
<div class="SECT2">
  <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="REALPROT-DIFF-INTERRUPTS-DATA">Giving Data to Real 
  Mode Interrupts</a></h2>
  <p>However, there's a more fundamental problem here! Most interrupts that take 
  segment registers as inputs use them to point to data, and they use the 
  segment registers in real-mode fashion (not as selectors). How can a protected 
  mode program give a real-mode interrupt data if this is the case?</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, the program can't just call a magic function that translates 
  a selector into a segment. This is impossible unless the selector is located 
  in the 20-bit address space of real mode and is less than 64k in length. Even 
  if it were possible, the offset would still be limited to 64k. Fortunately, 
  DPMI provides an alternative solution: providing a way for a protected mode 
  program to allocate a segment of memory that's guaranteed to be accessible in 
  real mode.
  <a href="http://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece291/resources/pmode/dpmi/api/310100.html" target="_top">
  DPMI function 0100h, &quot;Allocate DOS Memory Block,&quot;</a> allocates space in the 
  low 1 MB of RAM (the 20-bit address space visible to real-mode programs), and 
  returns <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">both</i></span> a selector 
  that can be used to access this memory from protected mode and a segment that 
  can be used to access this memory from real mode.</p>
  <p>Armed with the selector and segment values, a protected mode program can 
  copy the data it wants to give the real-mode interrupt into this memory and 
  give the real-mode segment to the interrupt. The real-mode interrupt then 
  reads the data, and everything works great!</p>
  <p>Naturally, the same process can work in reverse: the real-mode interrupt 
  writing into the memory and the protected mode program reading out of it after 
  the interrupt returns.</p>
  <p>So how does this DPMI function actually work internally? How does it ensure 
  the memory allocation is in the low 1 MB of RAM?
  <a href="http://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece291/resources/pmode/dpmi/api/310100.html" target="_top">
  DPMI function 0100h, &quot;Allocate DOS Memory Block,&quot;</a> has to go through a 
  number of steps to accomplish this:</p>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>Switch to real-mode.</li>
    <li>Perform a DOS interrupt call to allocate the memory the DOS is in charge 
    of (below 1 MB).</li>
    <li>Calculate the physical address of the memory DOS allocated (by shifting 
    the segment left by 4 and adding the offset).</li>
    <li>Allocate an LDT descriptor, and set its base address to the calculated 
    physical address and the length to the size of the allocated memory.</li>
    <li>Return the index of this LDT entry in <tt class="REGISTER">DX</tt></li>
  </ol>
  <p>Actually, all of these steps can be accomplished without too much trouble 
  by normal protected mode code. However, it's far easier just to use the DPMI 
  interrupt.</p>

    <p>The second thing to notice is that the input takes a pointer to data that 
    the protected mode program needs to provide. This means the program will 
    need to use the procedure detailed in
    <a href="tmp/realprot-diff-interrupts.html#REALPROT-DIFF-INTERRUPTS-DATA">
    Section 17.3.3</a> to put the string someplace where DOS can get to it.</p>

<P>&quot;Determine Keyboard Buffer Status&quot; is useful for things like games where you don't want
to stop to wait for a key.&nbsp; You want to move your JarJar around the
mine-field only when a key is pressed, but you still want everyone else to shoot
at him while you're not hitting keys. </P>

<P>Make your program print out your string until a key is pressed.&nbsp; Then
put the ASCII value for the key press into the first character of the string
before you print it out one last time. </P>

  <li>Move your &quot;Allocate DOS Memory Block&quot; code to the top, and your

  <li>Put the protected-mode selector and real mode segment that &quot;Allocate

<p>One last thing before we get into the good stuff.&nbsp; You know about this
graphics mode from <a href="http://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece291/lecture/Spring2003/Lecture12.pdf">Lecture 12</a>.&nbsp; Let's see how we can use it in protected mode. To get into the mode
is pretty straight forward.&nbsp; Here's the mode switching code from the
lecture:</p>
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><samp><font color="#808080">; Switch to 320x200x256 Mode</font><br>
      mov ah, 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#808080">; Subfunction to set the
      mode</font><br>
      mov al, 13h&nbsp; <font color="#808080">; Mode 13h is 320x200x256</font><br>
      int 10h&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#808080">; Video BIOS call</font><br>
      <br>
      <font color="#808080">; Do your pixel stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><br>
      <br>
      <font color="#808080">; Switch back to text Mode</font><br>
      mov ah, 0<br>
      mov al, 03h&nbsp; <font color="#808080">; Mode 03h is text mode.</font><br>
      int 10h</samp></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The hard part here is that in protected mode, you can't just blindly write to
segment 0A000h.&nbsp; First of all, <i> segments</i> are meaningless in
protected mode. Earlier, you allocated
a block of DOS memory and got a selector for it.&nbsp; Now you're going to have to
get a selector for the real mode memory for the screen, so this time <i>you</i>
give it the real mode address of the memory you want rather than having DPMI
find
the address of a free block.&nbsp; How do we do this? A look at the <a href="http://www.ece.uiuc.edu/ece291/resources/pmode/dpmi/ch5.g.html">DPMI
Functions by Functional Group</a> we find <a href="http://www.ece.uiuc.edu/ece291/resources/pmode/dpmi/api/310002.html"><tt>31
0002</tt> - Segment to Descriptor</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="center"><b>INT 31h, 0002h - Segment to Descriptor</b>

      BX = real mode <i> segment</i> address<br>
      <br>
      <b>Outputs:</b><br>
      Carry flag = clear if call was successful<br>
      AX = protected mode <i> selector</i> for real mode segment</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>Get a selector for video memory.&nbsp; The real mode segment for it is 0A000h.</li>
  <li>Go into video video mode 13h</li>
  <li>Draw a bunch of pixels into video memory using the selector you got.&nbsp;
    Some loop with different colors would be nice.&nbsp; Writing the least
    significant byte of the loop counter as your color gives you good variety,
    but do whatever you want.</li>
  <li>Wait for a Key Press.</li>
  <li>Return to text mode.</li>
</ul>

<p>Make it, run it, and most importantly, look in the Local Descriptor Table (Alt-L) at selector
DPMI gave you.&nbsp; This is the best example of how this selector/descriptor stuff
works because you can actually see a real, meaningful physical address!&nbsp; <a href="questions.html#Question9">Question
