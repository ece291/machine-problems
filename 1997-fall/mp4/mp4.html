<h2>Introduction</h2>

In the near future, battles will be fought in virtual environments.
The nastiest of these battles may very well be in the ECE291 laboratory.
For this assignment, we will render a 3-dimensional battlefield and
each be the captain of our own tank.
<p>
This is the beginning of a two-part machine problem.  
In this machine problem, you will code the graphic routines
and write a keyboard interrupt handler for a 3-D tank simulator.
For the graphics, you will write a routine to draw polygons on the 
screen, load PCX files, and use efficient string operations to
create smooth-motion (30+ frames/second) animation.
<p>
Our battlefield will be a square region with vertical walls.  As 
we move our tank toward a wall, the wall will appear larger.
As we move away, it will appear smaller.  At any given time, we
can see up to three walls on the screen.  
A screen dump of the running program (using calls from libmp4)
is shown below.

<p>

<H2>Drawing Polygons</h2>
We will render the walls in our 3-D world using 
multiple instances of a single graphic primitive: a four-sided polygon.
Figure 1(a) shows the type of polygon that we will be using
for this assignment.
<p>
The poloygon is most easily drawn by breaking the problem into three
filled regions, as shown in Figure 1.b.
Region 2 is the easiest, you just need to draw a rectangular box
from X1 to X2 going from Y2 down to Y4.
Recall that the string instructions covered in class for
<a href="../../lecture/l17.html">Lecture 17</a> <!-- string -->
are most efficient for fast graphics.
<p>
Drawing regions 1 and 3, are more difficult.
You must use Bresenham's Line Algorithm
to determine the points connecting (X1, Y1) to (X2, Y2) and (X1, Y3) 
to (X2, Y4).  Once you know the points on the line, you can draw horizontal
lines to fill in the region.  The derivation of Bresenham's algorithm
was covered in class in
<a href="../../lecture/l19.html">Lecture 19</a>. <!-- Bresenham -->
<p>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="poly.gif" ALIGN=CENTER width="640" height="480"></CENTER>
<p>
Once you determine which pixel appears on the diagonal; 
you can simply draw a fill line back to the other end of the triangle.
If the slope of the line is greater than 1, you will need to swap
your independent axis.   You will want to code this complex 
routine using several simplier subroutines.  It is up to you to 
determine a good set of modular subroutines.  Points will be deducted
for routines that attempt to draw the entire polygon using one, large,
ugly procedure.


<h2>Video Graphics</h2>
In order to reduce the amount
of screen flicker inherent in programs that use VGA graphics, we are going
to use double-buffering to drawn on the screen.  
After an entire image has been created, it will be quickly transferred
with the <i>MoveScreen</i> routine directly to the screen.  
With this implementation, you don't see this image while it
is being changed.
<p>
Because one page of graphics alone requires 64,000 bytes of information, 
more than one segment must be defined.
Four variables in different segments have been defined as follows:
<UL>
<LI><i>ScreenBuffer</i>: A double-bufferd "virtual" screen that holds 
    images as they are created.
<li><i>Background</i>: Background images of clouds. 
<LI><i>Foreground</i>: Foreground images (not needed until MP5).
<LI><i>ScratchPad</i>: A temporary buffer used to hold PCX image data 
    during decoding.</LI>
</UL>
A few steps are required to draw a video screen.
First, we call the <i>AnimateScreen</i> routine to 
transfer a horizontally shifted version of the Background image 
to the ScreenBuffer.  This routine not only erases the old 
images from ScreenBuffer, but it also creates the illusion of moving clouds.
Next, we call <i>DrawPoly</i> to draw polygons on ScreenBuffer to
represent the vertical walls.  
Once an entire image has been created in
ScreenBuffer, <i>MoveScreen</i> is called to blast the data from
ScreenBuffer to the VGA's video RAM (at <tt>A0000h</tt>).

<h2>Image Data</h2>
It would be tedious to define images using assembly code.
It is much more convienient to create an image using a standard image 
editor (such as PhotoPaint) and save the results in a file.
Our program then need only load this data when it executes.

<p>
For this MP, we will write the <i>LoadPCX</i> routine to 
open and read a .PCX file; run-length decode it; then
save the uncompressed data in a memory segment.  
DOS file services (software interrupts) are described in the lab 
manual and in your textbook. (You will need to open a file, 
point a register to the scratch segment, and issue the read command).  
Details of the PCX image format were discussed in class in
<a href="../../lecture/l22.html">Lecture 22</a>. <!-- PCX -->
PCX files use a slight variation of the Run-Length encoding 
technique covered in <a href="../mp2/mp2.html">MP2</a>.
A "run" of data corresponds to horizontal lines in the image.
You will find some very helpful example PCX code in your lab manual.


<h2>Keyboard Control</h2>
The last part of this machine problem involves reading input from
the user's keyboard.  To read of keys pressed simultaneously,
we need to replace the default keyboard handler with our own code.  
Your <i>InstKey</i> routine is called to install a new
handler into the vector table.  The <i>DeInstallKey</i> routine is
used to remove it (and restore the DOS default routine).  
<p>
Key presses affect the variables <i>ExitFlag</i>,
<i>Xoffset</i>, and <i>Yoffset</i>.  <i>ExitFlag</i> should be
set to 1 when the ESC key is pressed.  The <i>Xoffseg</i> variable holds
{-1, 0, 1} for {left key, no horizontal movement, right key} and 
<i>Yoffset</i> holds {-1, 0, 1} for {down key, no vertical movement, up key}.
The value of offset is undefined when arrows in opposite directions
are pressed together.  The topic of interrupts was discussed in great
detail during the <a href="../../lecture/l14.html">Lecture 14</a>
class period.  We discussed the operation of the 
keyboard controller during <a href="../../lecture/l16.html">Lecture 16</a>

<h2>C-Style Procedures</h2>
The routines in this MP should be implemented so that they can be
called from C.  As discussed in <a href="../../lecture/l10.html">Lecture 10</a>,
this involves making FAR procedure calls,
pushing arguments to the stack, and using BP to access the arguments passed
to a procedure.  Recall that C expects ASM functions to be
prefixed with an underscore.  <p>

Look at the code given in this assignment for examples of 
procedure calls with INVOKE. 
<p>

Details of the INVOKE command
can be found in the MASM on-line help (<tt>MASM /h</tt>) and in the 
MASM manual.  

<h2>Program Debugging</h2>
For your convenience, the program provides several debugging modes.
By invoking the program with a command-line argument between 1 and 5, 
you can specify which part of the code to debug.  Typing <tt>MP4 5</tt>, for
example, exercises all features of the program. Typing <tt>MP4 1</tt>
just exercises the drawing of a single polygon. 
Read and understand the MP4.ASM framework (given at the end of the assignment)
see how the program operations.
