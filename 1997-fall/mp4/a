or download the same files from the web as <a href="mp4.zip">mp4.zip</a>.

<LI>As with the other MP's, run NMake to build an executable program using
the given MP4 library functions.</LI>

<LI>To receive full credit for the assignment, you need to implement each of
the subroutines described above with your own code.&nbsp; As given, the
MP4.ASM file will run the library versions of those subroutines</LI>

that exercise each routine.

<LI>Be prepared to answer questions about any aspect of the operation of your
program.&nbsp; The TA's will not accept an MP if you cannot fully explain
the operation of any part of your algorithm or code.</LI>

<LI>Copy you programs to the handin floppy:
