# ECE 291/390 Machine Problem Archive

This repository contains as complete of an archive as can be reconstructed of
UIUC's ECE 291 (and ECE 390) machine problems (MPs or programming assignments)
from Fall 1996 through Spring 2006.  While many of these files are available as
of this writing from https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece390/, many of the MP
index pages on the site are broken due to server errors, and the long-term
maintainence of that website is uncertain as the course no longer exists at
UIUC.

## Execution Environment

Due to the fact these are largely 16-bit assembly language programs, they will
almost certainly require an emulated environment to run on modern machines.
All MPs prior to Fall 1999 and MPs 0-3 after that point should largely be able
to run in a DOS emulator.  MP4/5 in Fall 1999 and later started using protected
mode much more extensively, and for high resolution graphics were designed to
use the ex291 Windows extensions (also available on GitHub), which require a
32-bit Windows XP environment to provide the necessary NTVDM layer.

## Solutions

Unfortunately, nearly all of the MP solution code has been lost, as the
solutions were archived on a shared drive rather than the website.  Student
submissions from Spring 2001 through Summer 2005 exist, but have not been
included in this archive due to copyright and privacy concerns.

* Fall 2001 MP1: mp1soln.zip in that directory
* Spring 2003 MP4: See the 2003-spring/mandlebrot directory

## Partial Archives

* Fall 2003: No MP0, MP1
* Fall 2004: Except for MP3 and MP4, webpages only, no .zip or .asm files

## Authors

For later years, usually the author is noted in the header comments of the .asm
file.

* Spring 1999: Copyright John Lockwood (Network Tag, HP-Calc) with help from Josh Scheid (GUI front-end)
* Fall 1998: Copyright John Lockwood with help from Brandon Tipp (RSA), Josh Scheid (Tron), Sankalp Acharya (ZBuffer)
* Summer 1998: Copyright Jay Moorman. (File Parser, Error Detector, Black Jack, Bomb)
* Spring 1998 Copyright John Lockwood (Huffman Encoding) with help from Mike Carter (Everitt3D) and Dan Restelli (15-Puzzle)
* Fall 1997 Copyright John Lockwood (Battletank 3D Simulator, Score Distribution, Run-Length Encoder) with help from Dan Restelli (Visual Sorting)
* Summer 1997 Copyright Matt Plavcan (Paintboard, TSR-Screensaver, Infix calculator, ASM formatter)
* Spring 1997 Copyright John Lockwood (Tag, Lunar Lander, Bakery of Hanoi, Little (Visiting Assistant) Professor, Events Calendar)
* Fall 1996 Copyright John Lockwood (Maze3D, Maze, HPCalc, Class Standings) (first on-line class)

## Credits

This archive owes its existence to the assistance of Josh Potts, lecturer for
Fall 2001, Summer 2001, Spring 2001, and Summer 2000, who was able to provide
a full archive of the server side of the course website.
