<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>The game craps is one of the most well known dice games in existance. 
The idea behind the game is to predict the number the dice will land on, 
and bet accordingly. For this project, we will be implementing a sizeable 
subset of the full game of craps, wherein the pass bet, don't pass bet, 
come bet and don't come bet, are all simulated.
</p>

<h2>Problem Description</h2>


<p>In this machine problem, you will write seven basic functions which will 
serve to simulate the game. As was previously stated, this game is 
limited form of the full game of craps. </p>

<p>The game uses two six-sided dice in parallel, which together will yeild 
a number between 2 and 12, in a Gaussian distribution centered around 7. 
Our random number generator will simulate one die at a time, giving a number 
evenly distributed between 1 and 6. To get the full roll this function 
must be called twice and the results added together.</p>


<p>The game is actually played by placing wagers of varying sums in 
different areas of the playing field. Although there is no actual playing 
area involved in this MP, the basic types of bets (or "lines") are the same.</p>

<h3>Pass and Don't Pass bets</h3>

<p>To begin with, money is placed on the pass line or the don't pass 
line. (The "don't pass" line is the proper name of one of the wagering 
areas.) The dice are then rolled. (This is refered to as the "comeout 
roll".) If the dice come up on 7 or 11, whatever 
money was placed on the pass line is doubled and the player wins. if the 
dice come up on 2, 3, or 12, the player loses whatever money is on the 
pass line. The don't pass line is almost the exact opposite - a 2 or 3 is a 
winning bet, and a 7 or 11 will lose the player's money. On the don't pass 
line, a 12 is a "push", meaning no money is won or lost and the player 
gets their money back.</p>

<p>Any other number (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10) on a pass or don't pass bet 
results in a "point" being set. This means that the money previously on the 
pass or don't pass line is now dependant on the "point" being rolled 
again. For money previously on the pass line, if the "point" is rolled a 
second time, the money is doubled and the player wins. If a 7 is rolled, 
the player loses their money. The don't pass line is the exact opposite - 
if the "point" number is rolled again, the player loses their money, if a 7 
is rolled, the money is won back double. All other numbers besides the 
"point" or a 7 are ignored, and the dice are rolled again.</p>

<h3>Pass and Don't Pass example</h3>
<ul>
    <li>For example, let us say Bob puts down $20 on the pass line. A four is 
then rolled (the "comeout roll"), which becomes the point. 
<li>Bob then continues to roll dice in 
the following sequence: 11, 2, 8, and 6 are then rolled, which do nothing. 
<li>Bob then rolls a second 4, and thus recieves $40. Had Bob rolled a 7 
instead of a 4, he would have lost his money.
<li>Encouraged by his winnings, Bob then places $40 on the don't pass line. 
He then rolls a 12. Bob gets his $40 back, losing and gaining nothing., 
<li>Finally, Bob places $40 on don't pass line. An 11 is then rolled, so he 
loses his money and no point is set. 
</ul>

<h3>Come and Don't Come bets</h3>
<p>Two additional types of bets are the come and don't come lines. These 
are basically pass and don't pass bets made when a point is already set. 
The come line corresponds to the pass line, and the don't come line 
corresponds to the don't pass line. In both cases the point set with a pass 
or don't pass bet has no effect on a come or don't come bet. These bets 
can be made during any roll where point is already set from a pass or 
don't pass bet. A come or don't come bet cannot be made when there is no 
pass or don't pass point already set. Multiple come or don't come bets can 
be made during the same roll, and across multiple rolls when a pass or 
don't pass point is trying to be hit.  There can only be one pass or don't 
pass point set at a time, but multiple come or don't come points set at once. 
Obviously, however, there are only six possible point numbers and thus a 
maximum of six possilbe come or don't come points set. The come points 
persist even after a pass point has been hit.</p>


<h3>Come and Don't Come example</h3>
<ul>
    <li>For example, let's say Jane has set a point of 5 for a $10 pass line bet. 
At this point, Jane has $100 with $10 on the table.  
<li>She then makes a come 
bet of $20 and the roll lands on 11. She wins that come bet (since it was 
the first roll and come bets pay on 7 and 11.) Now Jane has $120 with $10 
and a pass point of 5. 
<li>Jane puts $25 on a come bet, and rolls an 8. Jane 
now as $35 on the table in two different bets, with a pass point set at 5, 
and a come point set at 8. 
<li>Jane then puts $30 on a second come bet, and 
rolls a 7. Because of this, she loses her $10 pass bet, her $25 come bet, 
but wins her most recent $30 come bet, giving her a grand total of $115, 
with no  money on the table.
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>At this point she cannot make another come or don't come bet, since no 
pass point is set. She therefore makes a don't pass bet $15 and rolls a 5. 
<li>She then makes a $20 don't come bet, and rolls a 6. At this point she has $35 
on the table in two sepearate bets. 
<li>She then makes a $20 don't come bet, 
and rolls a 9. She now has $55 on the table in three separate bets, with a 
don't pass point on 5, and two don't come points on 6 and 9 for $20 a 
piece. <li>She makes a thrid don't come bet for $20, and rolls a 5. This causes 
her to lose the original $15 don't pass bet, and sets a don't come point at 
5. She now has $60 in three separate bets on the table. 
<li>At this point, she 
cannot make any more come or don't come bets, so she makes a pass bet for 
$20, and rolls a 7. This wins her $80, $60 from her three don't come bets, 
and $20 from her pass bet, giving her a total of $150. </ul>

<h3>Finances</h3>

<p>In addition to simulating the game, students must also keep rudimetary 
track of the player's finances. The player (only one person can play the 
game at a time, at least in the 291 version) must start off with $1000, and 
the program should keep track of how much money they gains or loses over the 
course of various bets. If the player has no more money, they should not 
be allowed to make a bet. The minimum allowable bet is $5, and the maximum 
allowable bet is $200.</p> 

<H2>MP 2 Program Assignment</H2>

<p>Like MP1 the program will be provided as an operational executable. It 
is highly recommended that students spend time playing the pre-assembled 
executable until they understand how everything ties together. The 
students' job will be to replace 7 functions that are currently tied into 
the executable code as library routines. One by one, the students should 
replace these library codes with their own code that serves the same 
function.</p>

<p>The program can be run by typing <tt>mp2</tt> at the
command prompt.
</p>

<p>The students will also have the option of writing their own random 
number generator for bonus points. This routine will be graded according 
to how evenly the numbers 1-6 are distributed. The maximum total number of 
points will be 5. 

<h2>Hints</h2>
<ul>
<li>The LIBMP2 file contains executable library functions for each of the
routines that you need to implement.  
This allows you to run the program and understand how it works before you 
implment it.  You can test your program by stepping through the game and 
making sure the display and comparison functions work correctly.  You will only receive credit, however, for
the routines that you implement yourself. <p>

<li>When debugging your code in Codeview, you will find it helpful to use
the memory window to show you the memory location of the file and strings.
You can also use the watch window to keep track of variables in your 
code.<p>

<li>Do not assume that the file starts at memory location 0.<p>

<li>You may define new variables and function as needed.<p>

<li>For the rolldice function, you may want to divide the function up into 
multiple subfunctions becuase there are so many comparisons to be made.  
Remember you have to check if it's the first roll of a pass / don't pass 
line sequence and you also have to check and update many variables for the 
come / don't come bets.  You may do this any way you like, but the TAs 
used single dimension arrays of length 6 to implement the come and don't 
come bets.  These are given to you in the mp2.asm file.<p>

<li>Read and learn to use the different library functions specified in 
your lab manuals for the getnumber function.  You will find it helful to 
use binasc accordingly.<p>

<li>Play the game a lot before attempting to code it.  All messages and 
characteristics of the program not listed in this writeup should still be 
implemented.  For example, notifying the user when different bets are won 
or lost must be implemented.<p>
	
<li>Be very careful if you call another procedure not to destroy registers
that the calling procedure uses.<p>

<li>Remember to include function headers for each of your functions!<p>

<li>Remember to include comments within the functions you write!<p>

<li>START EARLY!  This is a very complicated MP.<p>

<li>Monitor the <a href="news:uiuc.class.ece291">newsgroup</a> for 
clarifications and help.</p>

<li>FUNCTIONALITY FOR ROLLDICE:
<li>Roll the dice, put in currentroll.
<li>Check to see if the roll was comeout roll.
<li>If so, evaluate the status of the player's money on the table for a 
comeout roll.
<li>Also make sure to set the point if a point needs to be set.
<li>If the roll is not a comeout roll, check if the dice hit a point or a 7.
<li>If either of these were hit, adjust money accordingly on pass or 
dontpass bets.
<li>Next, check the come and dontcome bets. You will have to loop through 
all possible bets. (6 possible come and dontcome bets.) Adjust money 
accordingly.
<li>Remember that come and dontcome bets are still in play during comeout 
rolls, even though these bets cannot be made during a comeout roll.
<li>If bets are won or lost, messages should display this fact.
</ul>

<h2>Subroutines</h2>

<p>This assignment has seven procedures. You will receive credit by 
replacing
each of these seven procedures listed below with your own code. Assume 
these function call library routines such as dspmsg as needed.</p>

how many times a single die lands on 1, 2, 3, etc. out of 30,000 rolls. 
Ideally each bin should be very close to 5000. The 5 bonus points will be 
allocated according to the following system:</p>
<ul>
    <li>All bins within 200 count of 5000: 5 points
     <li>All bins within 400 count of 5000: 4 points
     <li>All bins within 600 count of 5000: 3 points (note: this is the 
     accuracy of the provided random routine)
     <li>All bins within 1000 count of 5000: 2 points
     <li>A bin is past 1000 count of 5000: 1 point</p>
</ul>

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ul>
<li>You will begin this MP with the following files:
    <ul>
    <li><tt>MP2.ASM</tt>: Program Framework
    <li><tt>Makefile</tt>: Specifies how and when programs are assembled
        and linked.
    <li><tt>LIBMP2.LIB</tt>: Library functions for MP2
    <li><tt>LIB291.LIB</tt>: General-purpose library functions
    </ul>
<li>You may copy these files from the network drive to your home directory
    with the following command: <br>
    <tt>xcopy /s V:\ece291\mp2 W:\mp2</tt><br>
    or download the files from this server as <a 
href="mp2.zip">mp2.zip</a> 
<li>Add your code to <tt>MP2.ASM</tt>.
<li>Assemble and link your program by typing<br>
      <tt>nmake</tt><Br>
    This command reads <i>Makefile</i> then invokes MASM and LINK to build 
    an executable program.  
<li>Use CodeView (CV) to find and correct program errors. 
<li>Verify your program operation by testing the
    input test file.  You should alter the test file to check 
    different scenarios with your code.
</ul>

<h2>Final Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Print a copy of the MP2 grading report (<a 
href="mp2grade.html">MP2GR</a>).
   Double-check that your program is ready for demonstration.  You need to
   run through the test cases on the grading sheet, you WILL NOT be allowed
   to hand-in unless you have done this step.
  <li>Print MP2.ASM (Use GreenPrint32 to print at 4 pages/side.) 
  <li>Demonstrate your MP2.EXE to a TA or to the instructor.</li>
  <li>Be prepared to answer questions about any aspect of the operation of
   your program. The TAs will not accept an MP if you cannot fully explain
   the operation of your code and details of your implementation. Delayed
   MPs will be subject to late penalties as described in the course
   syllabus (10pts/day).</li>
  <li>The TA will copy your program to the demonstration disk.
  <li>Take your printouts to the same TA which approved your demonstration.
    Staple the grading sheet to the front of the MP2.ASM printout.  Be sure
    that your name appears in your code and on the grading sheet.
</ol>
