<h1>Drawing Strings of Text</h1>

<p>Drawing a string of text is straightforward.  We do it by calling the
DrawChar function for each character as it is typed and having DrawChar put the
output in an overlay buffer.  We then AlphaBlit this buffer to the screen.</p>

<h2>Format of font.png</h2>
<p>Font.png is an image with 128 characters in it.  It doesn't include a
lot of the control characters, though, so if you start typing them you
will see something that looks like spaces.</p>

<p>Each character is 16*16 pixels at 4 bytes per pixel.  They are lined
up such that for a given ascii value, you can merely shift it left to
account for 16 pixels * 4 bytes per pixel to find its upper-left corner.
For example, 'A' (41h) is located at the 10h * 41h'th pixel.  Its
address is 41h shifted left by 6: 1040h</p>

<p>The font has 128 characters, so it is 128*16 = 2048 pixels wide.
Keep this in mind as you're copying rows out of the image.</p>

<h2>Differently Colored Text</h2>
<p>The font.png image has something else special about it: it contains
an antialiased font that can be turned any color with ease.  How?  You
might be able to guess the answer with all this talk of alpha:
the characters are represented not by the color channels in each pixel but
rather by the alpha channel.  The color channels in font.png are all 0.</p>

<p>Since we're using AlphaBlit to actually draw the text on the screen, we can
easily change the color of the text simply by changing the color channels for
every pixel of each character to the color we want the text to be, and the
magic of AlphaBlit will do the rest for us!</p>

<p>So how should we change only the color channels of each 32-bit value to the
right color, while leaving the alpha channel untouched?  Probably the easiest
way, since the color channels in the original font are 0, is to OR in the color
value with the value loaded from font.png.</p>

<p>You can use either MMX to do this 2 pixels at a time or regular instructions
to do one pixel at a time.  I recommend you use MMX, as it will help you
prepare for writing the much more complex MMX code in AlphaBlit</p>

<p>When writing DrawChar(), make sure you don't modify the original font image.
Read from it, merge in the color channels, and write the result to the
destination buffer.</p>
