<h1>Miscellany</h1>
<p>On this page we talk about all functions that seemed small enough to
not even deserve their own page.</p>

<h2><a name="grfx">Graphics</a></h2>
<h3>void ClearImage(void)</h3>

<p>ClearImage performs a 640x450 copy of the current color, replacing
all but the bottom thirty rows of the buffer in selector _ImageBlock.
This, oddly enough, clears any picture you may have previously had.  Use
a string instruction for this.  It's really short.</p>

<h2><a name="mouse">Mouse</a></h2>
 <p>For handling the mouse you need procedures for <a
 href='index.html#installmouse'>installation</a>, <a
 href='index.html#removemouse'>removal</a>, and <a
 href='index.html#mousecallback'>handling</a> the mouse data.

 <p><strong>But!</strong></p>

 <p>The mouse handler isn't truly a handler at all.  It's a callback.  A
 callback is the best of both worlds: it gets called like a normal
 procedure, getting all data in standard places instead of having to
 perform odd I/O to get it; yet it is also called in interrupt fashion -
 only, and immediately, when data is available.</p>

 <p>Or to look at it slightly less positive way, it's still called from
 an interrupt, so you have to be careful about what you
 call--particularly no DOS interrupts.</p>

 <p>Luckily for you, the library does have a function available that gets
 a real-mode callback address for your protected mode callback:
 <a href="library.html#Get_RMCB">Get_RMCB</a>.  However, you will still need
 to tell the mouse driver to call the callback, and where the callback is.</p>

 <ul>
  <li>Use Get_RMCB to get a real-mode callback address for MouseCallback.
  Save the segment and offset in MouseSeg and MouseOff</li>
  <li>Call the Mouse interrupt (33h), function 0Ch to have the mouse
  driver call your callback on left mouse button press/release and mouse
  movement</li>
 </ul>

 <p>Removing the mouse callback is a matter of reversing your steps.
 <ul>
  <li>Again use the mouse interrupt, this time to tell the mouse not to
  call your callback - use segment:offset of 0000:0000 for "no callback"</li>
  <li>Then, use <a href='library.html#Free_RMCB'>Free_RMCB</a> to
  release the real-mode callback</li>
 </ul>

 <p>Now that you've got the callback installing, and removing, what does
 your actual callback have to do?  Again, very little - we're doing the
 actual processing of the data in the main loop.  So all the handler
 does is toss the data into the event queue.  Read about the queue next!</p>
</ul>

<h2>The Event Queue</h2>

<p>The event queue is used to ensure no mouse movements get lost while you
are handling the previous ones.  You will need to understand this to
construct your mouse handler so it can talk to Main. To implement the
queue we need a structure which contains all information for each event,
and we need to keep track of the locations currently filled by the
queue.  For this queue, we will use a circular array representation;
just remember these rules:</P>
<UL>
 <LI><TT>Queue</TT> is the queue
 <LI><TT>QueueFirst</TT> holds the offset of the first entry in the
 queue.
 <LI><TT>QueueNumEvents</TT> holds the number of Events in the queue.
 <LI>Use <TT>QUEUE_ELEMENTS</TT> (number of events that fit into the
 queue) and <TT>QUEUE_SIZE</TT> (total number of bytes allocated for the
 queue) to calculate the positions of the elements, and to not write
 outside of the queue.
 <LI>If <TT>QueueNumEvents</TT> is equal to <TT>QUEUE_ELEMENTS</TT>,
 then no elements may be added to the queue.
 <LI>If <TT>QueueNumEvents</TT> is zero, it implies the Queue is empty.
</UL>

<P>The Event structure is as follows:</p>

<PRE>STRUC Event
.Condition resw 1       ; Condition bitmask (in mouse handler format)
.X         resw 1       ; X coordinate in screen pixels from left
.Y         resw 1       ; Y coordinate in screen pixels from top
.Buttons   resw 1       ; Button status (in mouse handler format)
ENDSTRUC</PRE>

<p>This allows us to pass information around carefully, and efficiently.
When you add an event to the queue, increase the <TT>QueueNumEvents</TT>
counter appropriately.  Don't forget to wrap around the tail end of the
queue when placing the event in memory.  Follow the rule that if
increasing it causes you to run into the front of the
<TT>QueueFirst</TT> you should not add it.  Instead, you would normally
set some error flag, but we will not bother to handle this.
</P>

<P>
Use <TT>Event_size</TT> to refer to the number of bytes in an event,
and <TT>word [ebx+Event.X]</TT> to refer to the X data for an event at
the offset stored in ebx (esi and edi work as well), etc.  If you really
want to take advantage of the full instruction set, you can put the
event index in eax (for example) and then use word
[_Queue+eax*Event_size+Event.Y] to access the Y data for that element.  This
only works because Event_size is 8, one of the multiplication constants
allowed for memory addressing (yes, we did this on purpose: you might consider
using nicely sized structures like this for your final projects!).
