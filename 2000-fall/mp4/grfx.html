<h1>High Resolution Graphics Library</h1>

<p>Even text mode video is not enough for the blossoming ECE 291
student.  We want graphics, and we want them now!</p>

<p>Well, you'll get them now.</p>

<h2>How to Interface</h2>
<p>The interface to the High Resolution Graphics Library is quite
simple:</p>
<ul>
 <li>SetGraphics(640,480);</li>
 <li>mov es, [_VideoBlock]</li>
 <li>Write to 640x480x32bpp buffer through es</li>
 <li>call RefreshVideoBuffer</li>
 <li>call UnsetGraphics</li>
 <li>exit</li>
</ul>

<p>In fact that's so simple, I'll only mention a few things before I get
to the known problems with using the library.</p>

<ol>
 <li>Each pixel is RGBA from low byte to high byte, and takes 4 bytes to describe</li>
 <li>The buffer is 640*480*4 bytes long.  Remember the *4 on the end.
 Remember it when you go to the next row, and remember it when you
 advance a pixel.  It's important.</li>
 <li>Unlike the Text Video Mode, this is double buffered, and you cannot
 write directly to the screen.  Call _RefreshVideoBuffer if you want to
 see any results.  Feel free to put in more calls to this when debugging,
 but remember to remove it (for speed, etc.) once you're done.</li>
 <li>The one non-graphics thing you have to be aware of is that we've
 moved the keyboard.  Currently we're using IRQ 7, port 300 (you don't
 have to ACK the keyboard, but you do have to ack with the PIC with
 <tt>mov al, 20h; out 20h, al</tt>).  This lets us use the debugger, and
 solves some other problems, so it's worth the irregularity.</li>
</ol>

<h2>How to make use it</h2>
<p>This library is rather complicated in function to give you an
interface as similar as possible to what assembly has always used.  Due
to the way it functions, however, you get some perks that no other
assembly programmers have had before!</p>

<p>What you have to do to use it is the following:</p>

<p>In any DOS window you wish to run your assembly graphics program,
run either ex291 or ex291w.  ex291 is fullscreen, and is what we will
require for handins.  ex291w is windowed, and allows you to debug by
running cv32 mp4--you'll get both the graphics window and the codeview
window.</p>

<p>If you want to switch from one to the other, or for any reason wish
to remove the driver, simply run it again, and it will uninstall.  It
will tell you if it successfully installed or uninstalled, so you will
know its status.</p>

<p>If something goes horribly wrong, press CTRL-ALT-DEL and choose the
task manager.  Tell the ECE 291 Display Driver to exit (forcibly if
necessary).  You will need to restart the graphics driver (not the
machine) if this happens.</p>

<h2>Known Problems</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, as is often the case with the first round of any
software, there are some problems with the library.  So here are some of
the things that cause problems, so you can <em>avoid</em> them.  Or at
least, you can know that we know it crashes when you do them.  Or
something.

<ol>
 <li>The keyboard seems to fail on the second run in full screen mode.
 The mouse still works.  Since we handle them the same internally, we
 don't know why this happens.  We do hope to fix this soon. For now,
 just start a new DOS box each time.</li>

 <li>When debugging with cv32 in windowed mode, only switch between the
 cv32 window and the Graphics window.  Switching to any other window
 will sometimes completely freeze your program.</li>
</ol>
