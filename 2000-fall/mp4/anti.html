<h1>Anti-Aliased Line Drawing</h1>

<p>First, let's start with an example to show why we want to use
anti-aliased lines.  The lines on the left are drawn with something like
Bresenham's line algorithm.  The lines on the right are drawn with an
extended form of Bresenham's which anti-aliases.  They are shown both at
normal size and 4x zoom. Which do you think looks better?</p>

<p>For MP4, you need to implement the one on the right.  This tape will
self-destruct in five seconds.  ...four... ...three...</p>

<p>Just take me to the <a href="#algo">algorithm</a>!  I don't care if I
understand it!  Or scroll on for an explanation.</p>

<h1>Theory Behind Anti-Aliasing</h1>

<div style="float:right">
<img src="solidfill.png" width="360" height="270"
alt="Figure A: Ideal Unit-width Line on pixel grid">
</div>
<p>There are several models one can use to draw anti-aliased lines, with
differing quality results. Let's say I want to draw a line with a
thickness of 1, from (1,1) to (8,4).  Also, the ends should be
rectangular, rather than capped with a circle.  My "ideal" line would
look something like Figure A.</p>


<p>But when I want to display that on a screen, and my units above are
individual pixels, I simply cannot draw that.  Although Pixels are
arguably circles of light, because they go in a rectangular pattern, it
is easiest to represent them as squares.  (It also makes most of the
math nicer, if you ask me.)</p>

<h2>Rasterization</h2>
<div style="float:right">
<img src="firstrast.png" width="360" height="270"
alt="Figure B: y=round(f(x)) Approximation">
</div>
<p>So what should I do?  The first way I can think of to do this follows
the pseudocode based on the idea y=f(x):</p>
<ul class="eqn"><li>For x = x0 to x1
    <ul class="innerul"><li>y = (y1-y0) * (x - x0) / (x1 - x0) + y0</li>
    <li>DrawPixel (x, y)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>End For
</ul>
<p>And would result in something like Figure B.</p>


<p>Now, this algorithm has several downfalls:</p>
<ol>
 <li>There is a multiplication and a divide for every pixel.  Since they
 are integer mul/divs, they cannot be precalculated to save one of them.
 <li>There is also a multiply when converting from (x,y) to address.
 <li>This line is severely aliased.  It's jaggy.  It looks like a
 shallow staircase.  (These all mean the same thing.)
</ol>

<h2>What can I do about it?</h2>
<p>There are two main categories of problems we want to address now:
Speed and Appearance.  First let's look at a type of line drawing
algorithm called a Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA), and then we'll
actually get on to how we anti-alias a line.</p>

<h2>Digital Differential Analyzer</h2>

<p>It's easy to come up with:</p>
<div class="eqn">
y<sub>i</sub> = f(x<sub>i</sub>)<br>
y<sub>i</sub> = m * (x<sub>i</sub>-x0) + y0<br>
y<sub>i</sub> = (y1-y0) * (x<sub>i</sub>-x0) / (x1-x0) + y0
</div>

<p>You can greatly improve this algorithm, however, by realizing that you
draw these lines sequentially:</p>
<div class="eqn">
y<sub>i+1</sub> = m * x<sub>i+1</sub>+B<br>
y<sub>i+1</sub> = m * (x<sub>i</sub> + &Delta;x) + B<br>
y<sub>i+1</sub> = y<sub>i</sub> + m * &Delta;x
</div>

<p>Now all you need to do is keep track of y<sub>i</sub>, and round to
the nearest integer when you want to draw.  So now we've got an initial
calculation of m = (y1-y0) / (x1-x0), stored in some non-integer format,
which we can then just add to our y for each subsequent pixel.

<h2>Bresenham's Line Algorithm</h2>

<p>Bresenham found a way to turn the above non-integer calculations into
entirely integer calculations.  By tracking an integer y and an integer
d (distance from the ideal line), his algorithm allows you to draw a
line using only integer math.  For more information on actually
implementing Bresenham's Line Algorithm, see <a
href="http://www.ece.uiuc.edu/ece291/lecture/l19.html#Bline">Lecture
19</a>.</p>

<p>The other thing you should notice about these two algorithms is this:
since they iterate across the line (think of the across x in the above
example), adding to the drawn Y if we've crossed some threshold, we
don't really have to store just X and Y anymore.  We can store an
address, to which we add 1 whenever X increases, and add WIDTH whenever
Y increases.  This eliminates the last multiply-per-pixel.</p>

<p>Okay.  So the DDA and, better yet, Bresenham's Line Algorithm have
really sped up our line drawing.  That's problem 1.  Now we can draw an
ugly line really quickly.  So onward to problem 2--we want our lines to
look better.</p>

<h2>Anti-Aliasing</h2>
<p>If you look closely back at the Figure B,  you'll probably start to
notice a few more problems.  For instance:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Pixel (4,2) has less coverage than Pixel (3,2), yet they're both
 drawn fully black.
 <li>Pixel (2,2) has almost as much coverage as (4,2), and yet it's
 drawn fully white.
</ul>

<p>How can we know how much of a given pixel the line will cover?  Well,
we could go through a whole bunch of geometry, drawing the perpendicular
from the center of the pixel to the edge of the line, and then derive
some easy ways to find this.</p>

<div style="float:right">
<img src="outline.png" width="360" height="270"
alt="Figure C: Pixel Color by Coverage or Alpha">
</div>
<p>But this is ECE291, so we'll just jump to the answer.</p>

<p>Remember how Bresenham's Line Algorithm stored d, the distance from
the line to the center of the pixel, multiplied by some constant to make
it usable?  Well, we're about to use a variant of that to calculate
distance.  Once we're done, we'll get something that looks a lot like
Figure C.</p>

<p>One word of caution: remember how I said pixels could be considered
circles of light?  That's going to play an important role in our
calculation of coverage as a function of distance.  Specifically, we
want to have a relationship that looks like: coverage = k /
distance<sup>2</sup>.</p> 

<p>Why?  To be honest, I haven't worked out the math to be completely
sure.  The Gupta-Sproull algorithm, which is the pseudocode I based this
on, does a table lookup on distance to find coverage. My source didn't
have the table.  So I played with it, and found that using the inverse
of distance squared result looks much better than the linear result.
Feel free to experiment a little in your code and see what you like
best.  If you use something other than my values, though, know what they
are and be prepared to defend them.</p>

<a name="algo"><h1>The Actual Algorithm</h1></a>
<p>The Gupta-Sproull algorithm looks a lot like Bresenham's, with some
additional fun thrown in.  Like Bresenham's, we do an integer DDA, with
error function d.  But then we use d as part of the distance
calculation.</p>

<p>Here's the pseudocode, shamelessly copied and slightly modified from
<span class="cite">Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice, Second
Edition in C</span>.  It's on page 141 in my edition (section 3.18), if
you happen to have the book and prefer a physical copy.  Just be careful
to note the changes!</p>

<p>So, what does this do?  Well, in addition to the normal Bresenham's
style algorithm, it calls <span class="func">DrawPixelD</span> three
times - one for the pixel Bresenham's would draw, and then for one each
on either side (y±1 for a line in x).  These three pixels are all the
pixels the line may cover.</p>

<div style="float:right">
<img src="zoomline.png" width="360" height="270"
alt="Figure D: The Final Line">
</div>
<p>It passes <span class="func">DrawPixelD</span> another parameter,
which we shall call <span class="floatv">distance</span>.  To find <span
class="floatv">distance</span>, it sets <span class="intv">twovdu</span>
to <span class="intv">d</span>±<span class="intv">du</span>, and
multiplies it by the precomputed constant <span
class="floatv">invD</span>.  Then, depending on which pixel we need the
distance for, it either passes it verbatim, or takes <span
class="floatv">invD2du</span>, another precomputed constant, and either
adds or subtracts it from this constant.  Making a long process short,
<span class="func">DrawPixelD</span> sees distances ranging from <span
class="float">0.0</span> to <span class="float">1.5</span>.</p>

<p>And if you've been a good student and just generally gotten very
lucky by getting everything to work, You'll have something that looks
like a zoomed out Figure D.</p>

<h2>DrawPixelD</h2>

<p>Remember a few paragraphs back when I said something about
considering the inverse of distance squared instead of just a linear
distance?  Here's where I explain how you are to do that.</p>

<p>DrawPixelD gets passed a distance.  Since there isn't any convenient
way to pass double-precision floating point numbers (qwords) on the
parameter stack, I suggest passing them in on the FPU stack, as the top
element.  You can break it down into two dwords on the stack, but it's
not fun.  (It also requires you write both functions at once, as
libDrawPixelD() expects to find it in st0, and correspondingly
libAALine() puts it there.  Yes, this is not standard C procedure
calling.)</p>

<p>This distance ranges from 0.0 to 1.5, thanks to some nice geometrical
math (I'm willing to try to explain the full reasoning to you if you
catch me with the book).  At 0.0, the line is fully centered around the
pixel.  at 1.5 it's fully centered around the far pixel.  But what about
in-between?  What we want to do is somehow find an alpha such that:</p>

<div class="eqn">&alpha; = f(distance)</div>

<p>So what's our function?</p>

<p>Simple. First we normalize the 0.0--1.5 to 0.0--1.0 (the normal range
on alpha values).  Then we subtract it from 1 to reverse the meaning to
our normal meaning of alpha. (Normally an alpha of 1.0 means fully
opaque, while an alpha of 0.0 means fully transparent.  Our normalized
distance was the reverse of that.)  Next, we apply the magic step of
squaring this value, which lessens almost all of the possible values
(just consider the graph of x<sup>2</sup> from 0 to 1).  Finally we
multiply by 255 to make it an integer, and we've got our alpha.</p>

<p>To summarize that paragraph as an equation:</p> <div
class="eqn">&alpha; = 255 * (1 - (distance * 2/3))<sup>2</sup></div>
<p>Which is a number from 0 to 255.  Apply this to each of your channels
just like you did in <a href="ablit.html">AlphaBlit</a> (only don't use
MMX!) and plot your pixel.  Don't forget the first parameter, addr, was
the address in the VideoBuf selector.</p>

<h2>No MMX in DrawPixelD</h2>
<p>Why not use MMX?  Due to the design choices of Intel, it's extremely
slow to switch between floating point and MMX instructions.  Since we
need floating point for most of this algorithm, it's faster to composite
the four channels individually than to switch into MMX, use MMX
operations on all four channels at once, and switch back to floating
point.</p>

<p>And we've only got one pixel anyway, not two.</p>
