<h1>Alpha-Blitting</h1>

<p>First, let's start with an example to show why we want to use
alpha-blitting.  The image on the left is a standard drop-shadow, drawn
darkening a white background.  This is done directly, with a single-bit
transparency: on or off.  The image on the right uses an "alpha" channel
to represent the shadow as a dark spot with varying opacity.  They are
both shown on a white and a grey background.  Which do you think
looks better?</p>

<div align="center">
<img src="drop.png" width="407" height="300" align="middle" alt="Example
Alpha compositions: Drop shadows on two backgrounds (capture)"><br>
</div>

<p>Okay, so the above is really just a screenshot of the <a
href="drop.html">actual effect</a>, as IE doesn't yet display these
correctly.  I guess this means you can outdo IE, by properly
implementing the one on the right.</p>

<p>Just take me to the <a href="#algo">algorithm</a>!  I don't care if I
understand it!  Or scroll on for an explanation.</p>

<h1>Theory Behind Alpha Blitting</h1>

<p>There are two big pieces to the idea of alpha blitting.  If you're
good at guessing your way to an A on multiple choice tests, you'll
probably already have guessed them: alpha opacity and blitting.  I'm going to
talk about blitting first, because it's simpler.  You've already done
it.  You may wish to jump ahead to the idea of <a
href="#alpha">alpha opacity</a> instead.</p>

<h2>Blitting</h2>
<p>Blitting is really easy.  You make a copy of an image in another
place.  You do it really fast.  This is what allows you to draw a mouse
cursor, or characters of a font, or just about anything you see in a
graphical user environment.  The RefreshScreen of MP3 was a form of
blitting.</p>

<p>There's just one trick to a general blitting function: your source
and destination formats may not be the same.  For instance, when you go
to draw the characters of the font to the screen, if you try to draw
16*16 pixels directly in order, the result will be awful.</p>

<h2>Image Widths</h2>
<p>Why?  Simple.  The widths of the source and destination images aren't
actually 16.  Nope, neither of them.  In MP3, this kind of situation
came up comparing the 4*4 piece with the 14*26 board, and again drawing
the 14*26 board to the 80*25 screen.  In each of those cases, however,
the source width corresponded to the width you wanted to draw.</p>

<div style="float:right; margin:30px;">
<img src="font-a.png" width="185" height="50"
alt="@ABC of font.png, with a box around A">
</div>
<p>In this MP, this won't always be the case.  Back to the example of
the font.  In the image you can see a small section of the actual png,
enlarged to be extra-visible.  I've drawn a blue box around the section
we want to copy.</p>

<p>Once we find the address corresponding to the upper-left pixel of
that box (which is easy--just see the section on <a
href="text.html">drawing text</a>) and the address for the upper-left
pixel of our destination, we're home free.  Almost.
</p>

<h2>Source Width</h2>
<p>The address upper-left corner pixel (0,0) of the letter A is 1040.  If you
have to ask how I got that, you haven't read the <a
href="text.html">text</a> section yet.  (Have I given you the link
enough yet?)  Through a little deduction, you can easily realize that
(1,0) is at 1040+1.  But what about (0,1)?  That takes a bit more
specialized knowledge--how wide is the image?  (Hint: it's 2048 pixels
wide.)  So do you now know where (0,1) of the letter A is?  1040+2048?
Good.</p>

<p>Whoops!  Wrong.  But that's because I lied--the upper left corner is
really at 4160 (1040*4), and the width is really 8192 (2048*4), because
each pixel takes 4 bytes to describe.  Don't you forget it!</p>

<h2>Destination Width</h2>
<p>How about drawing it to the screen?  Simple.  Lets say we've found
that address 41024 (0A040h) or (16,16) is where we want to start.
The pixel (17,16) is pretty obviously at 0A044h (remember the 4 bytes
per pixel), but where is (16,17)?</p>

<p>Again, consider the width: 640*4.  So pixel (16,17) is at
41024+640*4, or 0A040h+0A00h.  Think you can properly align all the
pixels from the source to the destination yet?  I hope so!  Now it's
time to talk about the meaning of that dreaded word "alpha."</p>

<a name="alpha"><h2>Alpha Opacity</h2></a>
<p>A lot of people think of transparency when they hear the word "alpha"
in the context of graphics.  They're right, sorta.  Alpha really refers
to the opacity of a pixel, which is derived generally from the coverage
of a pixel.</p>

<div style="float:right">
<img src="triangle.png" width="360" height="270"
alt="Figure A: Outlined Coverage of a Triangle on a pixel grid">
</div>
<p>What do I mean by the coverage of a pixel?  Simple.  Let's say you're
drawing a triangle.  The bottom and the left of the triangle are
horizontal and vertical, respectively.  The remaining side is at
45&deg;.  Now fill this triangle with a blue color.  Now draw it to the
screen.  The outline, zoomed in, is shown in Figure A.</p>

<p>Uh-oh.  Where are the 45&deg; pixels?  For that matter, if all these
lines go through the centers of pixels, chances are the left and bottom
and upper-right include a lot of half-covered pixels; the lower-left
corner has a one-quarter covered pixel and the two remaining corners
have about a one-eighth covered pixel, as visualized in Figure A.
Imagine how bad this gets when you slide the triangle up by a third of a
pixel.</p>

<h2>The Over Operation</h2>
<p>So how do you turn this into actual pixels?  The simplest way, and
the way we're using, is called the Over Operation.  To draw color A with
coverage &alpha; over color B, the resulting color C is calculated as
follows:</p>

<div class="eqn">
C<sub>r</sub> = (&alpha;<sub>r</sub> * A<sub>r</sub>) +
((1-&alpha;<sub>r</sub>) * B<sub>r</sub>)<br>
C<sub>g</sub> = (&alpha;<sub>g</sub> * A<sub>g</sub>) +
((1-&alpha;<sub>g</sub>) * B<sub>g</sub>)<br>
C<sub>b</sub> = (&alpha;<sub>b</sub> * A<sub>b</sub>) +
((1-&alpha;<sub>b</sub>) * B<sub>b</sub>)
</div>

<p>Or more succinctly, as we only have one &alpha;, apply this to each
channel independently:
<div class="eqn">C = (&alpha; * A) + ((1-&alpha;) * B)</div>

<div style="float:right">
<img src="triangle-over.png" width="360" height="270"
alt="Figure B: Triangle Drawn with Over Compositions, alpha by coverage">
</div>
<p>When we apply this to the case as listed above, with coverage
values one, one-half, one-quarter, and one-eighth, we get something that
looks like Figure B, only not quite so zoomed in, and no grid.</p>

<p>Things like this are where alpha opacity values originally come from.
Don't worry about how to calculate the alpha value, as we'll just be
using images that come with an alpha value for you.  Concentrate on how
to apply it using the over operator.</p>

<p>Here's how the value for the lower-left corner pixel was calculated,
assuming a white background (B) upon which you draw a pure blue pixel
with 25% coverage:</p>

<div class="eqn">
C = (&alpha; * A) + ((1-&alpha;) * B)<br>
C = (0.25 * {0.0, 0.0, 1.0}) + (0.75 * {1.0, 1.0, 1.0})<br>
C = {0.0, 0.0, 0.25} + {0.75, 0.75, 0.75}<br>
C = {0.75, 0.75, 1.0}
</div>

<p>As you can see, the math is simple.  But it does involve
multiplications, and hence takes a long time.  In the next section, we
cover an algorithm optimized to use MMX instructions, thus calculating
all four channels of two pixels at once.</p>

<a name="algo"><h1>The Actual Algorithm</h1></a>

<p>The MMX enhanced algorithm does exactly what the sections above
describe, only faster.  And the code is harder to read. Before that,
though, let's make one important optimization.  Remember how multiplying
takes a lot more time than adding?  Well, here's what we can do:</p>

<div class="eqn">
C = (&alpha; * A) + ((1-&alpha;) * B)<br>
C = (&alpha; * A) + B - (&alpha; * B)<br>
C = (&alpha; * (A-B)) + B
</div>

<p>Note how we changed two multiplies and two additions/subtractions
into one multiply and two additions/subtractions.  This will speed
things up noticeably.  Now that we've simplified our equation, let's
harness the power of MMX (one of the few things it's good at!) for our
algorithm.</p>

<p>Here's the pseudocode, adapted from Intel's very own code to perform
Alpha Compositing into a 15 bit image.  (Note: since the result in their
code is 15 bits, and ours is 32, the code itself would likely be more
confusing than helpful.)</p>

<ul>
 <li>Set up the range for your composite</li>
 <ul class="innerul">
  <li>Copies per row = width(pixels) / 2 <span class="comment">/* Watch out for going off the right side! */</span></li>
  <li>Rows to copy = height(pixels) </li>
  <li>Source Row Increment = (source width - destination width) * 4 <span class="comment">/* Unless truncated above */</span></li>
  <li>Destination Row Increment = destination width <span
  class="comment">/*640*/</span> * 4</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Perform a alpha compositing blit on two pixels</li>
 <ul class="innerul">
  <li>Load two source pixels into an MMX register (as eight bytes)</li>
  <li>Load two destination pixels into an MMX register (as eight bytes)</li>
  <li>Unpack (bytes to words) both into a register per pixel at 4 words each</li>
  <li>Copy out the source alpha byte into four words in another MMX register</li>
  <li>For each pixel:</li>
  <ul class="innerul">
   <li>Subtract the destination from the source, storing to the source register</li>
   <li>Multiply by alpha</li>
   <li>Shift left destination (in words) to align the following addition</li>
   <li>Add [alpha * (source - destination)] to destination, storing in destination register</li>
   <li>Add _RoundingFactor (in words) to destination to round the upcoming division</li>
   <li>Shift right to divide by 256, thus fitting into a byte per channel</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Pack both halves back together with proper saturation - be sure to get the order right!</li>
  <li>Store both destination registers into the destination image</li>
 </ul>
 <li>Loop properly over your image, according to your previously
 calculated width and height increments</li>
 <li>Reset the FPU/MMX registers to FPU with <tt>emms</tt> (empty mmx
 state)</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what does this do?  It pleases a former TA immensely, as this
algorithm uses PUNPCKLBW--his favorite MMX opcode.  No really!</p>

<p>More importantly, though, it allows you to calculate the alpha
compositing of two pixels in under the time it would have taken you to
composite two <em>channels</em> without MMX.  You'll really get to see
this when you calculate it per channel when drawing the <a
href="anti.html">Anti Aliased Line</a>.
