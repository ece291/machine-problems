<h1 align="center"><FONT size=+2><b><i> MASM vs. NASM</i></b></FONT></h1>
<P>Notice that NASM directives are much different than MASM ones.  While the NASM help files provide very detailed information
about all of the NASM directives as well as the macro system, here's a short overview of most of
the ones used here:</P>
<TABLE border=2><TR>
<TD><CODE>%include</CODE></TD>
<TD colspan=2>This preprocessor command works just like <CODE>#include</CODE> in C.&nbsp;
  It just inserts the file you tell it into your code in it's place.</TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD><CODE>BITS 32</CODE></TD>
<TD colspan=2>This directive tells NASM this is a 32-bit assembly file.</TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD valign=top rowspan=4><CODE>SECTION</CODE></TD>
<TD colspan=2>This directive tells NASM what section everything between it and the next
SECTION directive will go into.  There are three sections most commonly used:</TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD><CODE>.bss</CODE>:</TD>
<TD>Uninitialized data (similar to <CODE>dw(?)</CODE> in MASM)</TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD><CODE>.data</CODE>:</TD>
<TD>Initialized data</TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD><CODE>.text</CODE>:</TD>
<TD>Program code</TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD><CODE>resb</CODE>, <CODE>resw</CODE>, <CODE>resd</CODE></TD>
<TD colspan=2>The uninitialized versions of <CODE>db</CODE>, <CODE>dw</CODE>, and <CODE>dd</CODE>.</TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD><CODE>times</CODE></TD>
<TD colspan=2>NASM version of MASM's <CODE>dup</CODE>.</TD>
</TR></TABLE>

<P><B>NASM Is Case-Sensitive</B>
<BR>One simple difference is that NASM is case-sensitive. It makes a difference whether you call
your label <CDOE>foo, <CODE>Foo</CODE> or <CODE>FOO</CODE>.

<P><b>Uninitialized (.bss) Section</b>
<BR>Sure MASM could have uninitialized variables with "dw ?" but this
was totally stupid because everyone knew it started out with a value of
zero. Why have an uninitialized section? Let me Answer that question with another: Where are the initial values for the
initialized variables stored? They must be assembled and linked into the
executable, and so they must take up space on disk there. In MASM, if you declare a
bunch of data, it will devote part of the executable to that data. All
of the segments declared in the assembly file are
included in the .exe file. This is pretty stupid because there's no reason
64k of zeros need to be stored in the .exe file. The situation is even
worse in protected mode where you'll want to declare 4MB buffers for
high-resolution images. Not only does this data take up space on disk, but
it takes forever to load it all into memory.<P>So back to the uninitialized Section. When the
protected-mode program gets loaded, the loader reads all the initialized data right from the
file into memory. It also reads <i>one number</i> telling it how much
uninitialized data there was, allocates that much space for it in
memory, and zeros all of it. Much smarter, right? If a variable doesn't need an initial
value, put it in the uninitialized section.<P>Why is the code section called
.text and the uninitiated section called .bss? Standard UNIX / C names for
things don't make a whole lot of sense: A guy asks his wife, "Why do
you always cut the ends off your pot roast?" She responds,
"Because that's what my mother always did." He asks her mother
who replies, "That's what <i>my</i> mother always did." Luckily
enough the grandma is still alive and when the guy asks her, she laughs and
replies, "Because I never had a pot big enough for it."  (For those
of you who REALLY want to know: <a href="http://compilers.iecc.com/comparch/article/98-01-015">look here</a>).

<P><b>Labels are Everything.</b>
<BR>This was true in MASM too, but people for some reason believe that the
&quot;proc&quot; stuff was magical.&nbsp; NASM has no build in proc, so
everything is a label.&nbsp; A subroutine can be nothing but a label that you
&quot;call&quot; to instead of &quot;jmp&quot; to.&nbsp; Of course the call will
push the return address on the stack, and the &quot;ret&quot; a the end of your
subroutine will pop it, so you can't just &quot;jmp&quot; to your subroutine or
it will return to some random value that just happened to be on the stack.

<P>Also, you may notice the widespread use of <CODE>.label</CODE>'s.  These are "local" labels that are local to
the last label without a dot before it.&nbsp; This is so you don't have to worry
about having two labels with the same name. You also don't need a colon after the
label name, but it has to appear on a line by itself.

<P><B>NASM Requires Square Brackets For ALL Memory References</B>
<BR>NASM was designed with simplicity of syntax in mind. One of the design goals of NASM is that
it should be possible, as far as is practical, for the user to look at a single line of NASM code and
tell what opcode is generated by it. You can't do this in MASM.&nbsp; If you declare, for example,<br>
<table border="1" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">

<P><samp>foo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; equ 1<br>
bar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dw 2<br>
<br>
mov ax, foo&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#808080">; MASM spits out <b>mov ax, 1</b></font><br>
mov ax, bar&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#808080">; MASM spits out <b>mov ax, word ds:[12]</b>  &nbsp;</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#808080">;
if offset
bar happens to be 12.</font></samp></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<P>The bottom two lines generate completely different opcodes, despite having identical-looking syntaxes.</P>
<P>NASM avoids this undesirable situation by having a much simpler syntax for memory
references. The rule is simply that any access to the <I>contents</I> of a memory location requires
square brackets around the address, and any access to the <I>address</I> of a variable doesn't. So an
instruction of the form <CODE>mov ax, foo</CODE> will <I>always</I> refer to a compile-time constant, whether it's an
<CODE>EQU</CODE> or the address of a variable; and to access the <I>contents</I> of the variable bar, you must code
<CODE>mov ax, [bar]</CODE>. This sounds nice here, and it is, but <b>You <i> will</i> forget this when you code!</b></P>
<P>This also means that NASM has no need for MASM's <CODE>OFFSET</CODE> keyword, since the
MASM code <CODE><b>mov ax, offset bar</b></CODE> means exactly the same thing as NASM's <CODE><b>mov ax, bar</b></CODE>. </P>

</samp></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<P>NASM, in the interests of simplicity, also does not support the hybrid syntaxes supported
by MASM and its clones, such as <CODE>mov ax, table[bx]</CODE>, where a memory reference is denoted by one
portion outside square brackets and another portion inside. The correct syntax for the above is
&quot;<CODE>mov ax, [table+bx]</CODE>&quot;&nbsp; This is what it looks like
when you disassemble MASM generated objects anyway, right?&nbsp; Likewise, &quot;<CODE>mov ax,
es:[di]</CODE>&quot; is wrong and &quot;<CODE>mov ax, [es:di]</CODE>&quot; is right.</P>

<P>It's <b>very</b> important to understand how NASM works.&nbsp; If nothing
else shows up about protected mode on an exam, this will:</P>

<ul>
  <li>Names you declare with <b><samp>equ</samp></b> are &quot;searched and
    replaced&quot; by a constant -- the <i><b>value</b></i> you give them.</li>
  <li>Names you declare with <b><samp>db</samp></b>, <b><samp>dw</samp></b>, and
    <b><samp>dd</samp></b> are &quot;searched and replaced&quot; by a constant
    -- the <i><b>address</b></i> of the memory it allocated for you.</li>
  <li><b><samp>mov ax, 42h</samp></b> will move the 42h into ax.&nbsp; This
    constant might be a <i>value</i> that came from an <b><samp>equ</samp></b>,
    an <i>address</i> that came from <b><samp>db</samp></b>, <b><samp>dw</samp></b>,
    or <b><samp>dd</samp></b> , or just a plain old number that you typed.</li>
  <li><b><samp>mov ax, [42h]</samp></b> will move the value in memory at address
    42h.&nbsp; This constant also might be a <i>value</i> that came from an <b><samp>equ</samp></b>,
    an <i>address</i> that came from <b><samp>db</samp></b>, <b><samp>dw</samp></b>,
    or <b><samp>dd</samp></b> , or just a plain old number that you typed.</li>
</ul>

<P><B>NASM Doesn't Store Variable Types</B>
<BR>NASM, by design, chooses not to remember the types of variables you declare. Whereas MASM
will remember, on seeing <CODE><b>var dw 0</b></CODE>, that you declared var as a word-size variable, and will then
be able to fill in the ambiguity in the size of the instruction <CODE><b>mov var, 2</b></CODE>, NASM will deliberately
remember nothing about the symbol var except where it begins, and so you must <i> explicitly</i> code<b>
<CODE>mov word [var], 2</CODE></b>.&nbsp; Again, this has to do with the ability
to look at any single line of NASM code and know exactly what is going on.

<P><B>NASM Doesn't ASSUME</B>
<BR>As part of NASM's drive for simplicity, it also does not support the ASSUME directive.
NASM will not keep track of what values you choose to put in your segment registers, and will
never <I>automatically</I> generate a segment override prefix.

<P><B>Floating-Point Differences</B>
<BR>NASM uses different names to refer to floating point registers from MASM: where MASM
would call them <CODE>ST(0)</CODE>, <CODE>ST(1)</CODE> and so on, NASM chooses to call them
<CODE>st0</CODE>, <CODE>st1</CODE> etc.
<P>NASM does not declare uninitialized storage in the same way as MASM: where a
MASM programmer might use <CODE>stack db 64 dup (?)</CODE>, NASM requires <CODE>stack resb 64</CODE>, intended to be
read as `reserve 64 bytes'. </P>

<P><b>How This Affects 291</b><br>
NASM syntax is <i>much</i> better than MASM syntax.&nbsp; It we had started you
out with NASM, variables and such would have made much more sense.&nbsp; You
aren't used to NASM, though.&nbsp; You <i>will</i> have problems.&nbsp; You <i>will</i>
try to move the contents of a variable without []'s and it will move the
variable's offset instead.&nbsp; Read this section many times.&nbsp; If
something doesn't seem to work, read this section.&nbsp; Before you call over a
TA, read this section.&nbsp; Remember both syntaxes for your exam coding
questions -- we'll tell you which to use. </P>

&quot;feel&quot; the different syntax.&nbsp; Trust me on this!

<P>Typing in all those commands every time would be a pain, so smart people
started putting all those commands in a script so you only had to type them in
once and just run the script.&nbsp; Even smarter came up with this concept of
Makefiles.&nbsp; Makefiles have rules that tell how to make different types of
files.&nbsp; You want to make a <b><samp> .o</samp></b> file?&nbsp; Well you need to run NASM on the

bunch of <b><samp>.o</samp></b> files together and stubify the sucker.&nbsp; The other big thing
about make files is that they do dependency checking.&nbsp; You want to make the
<b><samp>
bob.o</samp></b> file?&nbsp; That file requires the <b><samp>bob.asm</samp></b> file, so let's check to see if
the <b><samp> bob.asm</samp></b> file is newer than our current <b><samp> bob.o</samp></b> file.&nbsp; If it's not, we
don't have to remake it.&nbsp; This way you only remake the things that have
changed.
When you type &quot;nmake&quot;, the nmake program will look in the &quot;Makefile.&quot;&nbsp;
We want the Makefile to do what we did up there, only better.</P>

<P>Here is how a Makefile works:</P>

    that begins with &quot;<b><samp>BOB:</samp></b>&quot; and runs the next line.</li>
  <li>For example, when you type &quot;<b><samp>nmake clean</samp></b>&quot; it will look for the

    <ul>
      <li>This line has a dependency after the colon, which we put in there to tell
        make that you need to have an <b><samp>var.</samp></b><b><samp>o</samp></b> before you can make
        <samp><b>var.</b></samp><samp><b>exe</b></samp>.&nbsp; Also, it

        doesn't need to be remade if the <b><samp>var.</samp></b><b><samp>o</samp></b>
        file doesn't need to be remade.&nbsp; (It checks the dependencies of <b><samp>var.</samp></b><b><samp>o</samp></b>)</li>
      <li>If <b><samp>var.</samp></b><b><samp>o</samp></b> doesn't exist yet or if
        it's dependencies (<b><samp>var.</samp></b><b><samp>asm</samp></b>)
        have changed, make does the equivalent of &quot;<b><samp>nmake var.o</samp></b>&quot;</li>
      <li>This looks for a &quot;<b><samp>var.</samp></b><b><samp>o:</samp></b>&quot; rule. It finds a <i>generic</i> rule in the &quot;<b><samp>.asm.o</samp></b>&quot; line.</li>
      <li><b><samp>var.</samp></b><b><samp>o</samp></b> depends on <b><samp>var.</samp></b><b><samp>asm</samp></b>, so if
        <b><samp>var.</samp></b><b><samp>asm</samp></b> is newer than <b><samp>var.</samp></b><b><samp>o</samp></b> or if
        <b><samp>var.</samp></b><b><samp>o</samp></b> doesn't exist, it will run
        NASM.</li>
      <li>On the NASM line there is a &quot;<b><samp>$&lt;</samp></b>&quot;, which
        gets replaced by the matching source file's name, which is &quot;<b><samp>var.asm</samp></b>&quot;
        in this case.</li>
      <li> &quot;<b><samp>$*</samp></b>&quot; gets replaced by the matching source's filename,
        but without the extension, so just &quot;<b><samp>var</samp></b>&quot; in this case.</li>
      <li> &quot;<b><samp>-iv:/pmodelib/include/</samp></b>&quot; adds the 291 PM library include directory to the include path.  More on this later.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you type &quot;<b><samp>nmake</samp></b>&quot; with no arguments, it looks for the first
    rule and does it.&nbsp; In this case it's the &quot;<b><samp>all:</samp></b>&quot; rule, which
    will depends on <b><samp>var.</samp></b><b><samp>exe</samp></b>&nbsp; If <b><samp>var.</samp></b><b><samp>exe</samp></b> needs updating,
    it will execute the &quot;<b><samp>var.</samp></b><b><samp>exe:</samp></b>&quot; rule. etc, etc, etc...</li>
  <li>You can make a huge build tree and all sorts of complicated dependencies
    with Makefiles.&nbsp; These huge build trees are usually made every night
    for large coding projects.&nbsp; If someone does something stupid which
    causes an error in everyone's build, they've &quot;broken the build
    tree&quot; and at the very least are often forced to buy beer for everyone.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Pull up a DOS window, go into your tutorial directory, and type &quot;<samp><b>nmake
    clean</b></samp>&quot; which run's your &quot;<b><samp>clean:</samp></b>&quot;
    rule.&nbsp; What does this do again? It deletes all the <b><samp>var.*</samp></b>
    files except <samp><b>var.asm</b></samp>. We do this because unless you
    change your <b><samp>var.asm</samp></b> file, make won't do anything because
    it will know that everything is up to date.</li>
  <li>Type &quot;<samp><b>nmake var.o</b></samp>&quot; to make run NASM and make
    the <b><samp>.o</samp></b> &nbsp; This was just to show you that you
    actually could run individual make rules.</li>
  <li>Type just plain&nbsp; &quot;<samp><b>nmake</b></samp>&quot;. This will run the make program
    on the first rule.&nbsp; This rule runs &quot;<samp><b>nmake var.exe&quot;</b></samp>
    which runs other rules until everything is made.</li>
  <li>Type &quot;<b><samp>dir</samp></b>&quot; to see all the stuff that got spit out.</li>
  <li>Type &quot;<b><samp>var</samp></b>&quot; to run your program.&nbsp;
Nothing?&nbsp; Good.</li>
  <li>Type &quot;<samp><b>cv32 var</b></samp>&quot; to debug your program.&nbsp;
(<b>Alt-H</b> is your friend.&nbsp; <b>F8</b> will get you started.)</li>
