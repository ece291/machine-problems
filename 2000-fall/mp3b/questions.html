<h1>Machine Problem 3 (part B)</h1>
<h1>Grading Sheet</h1>
<p>You have to do these questions as your going along in the tutorial.&nbsp;
Otherwise they'll be very out of context.&nbsp; As you go along, jot down some answers to these questions.&nbsp; When you
&quot;handin,&quot; the TA will will go over all of these questions with you and
make sure you know everything.&nbsp; Each question you know will be worth about
a half of a point for a total of five points for the questions.&nbsp; The point
is not to trick you, but to make sure you understand what's going on.</p>
