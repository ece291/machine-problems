<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>Tetris is a well-known video game. Seven different shaped pieces fall 
from the top of the playing field one after another. The object of the game is to keep the 
pieces from piling up to the top of the playing field. To do this, you can move pieces left
or right, or rotate them clockwise or counterclockwise as they fall. When you completely fill 
in a line of the playing field with parts of pieces, the line is cleared, and all lines above
it move down.

<h2>Problem Description</h2>

<h3>Text Mode Video</h3>
This game will be written in text mode video.  Read lecture 12 and chapter 10 in the lab
manual for information on text mode video.  Since the characters in text mode video are 
twice as high as they are wide, each individual array value for both the pieces and the 
playing field must be drawn twice to the buffer.  This will eliminate the pieces and 
playing field appearing very narrow.  Also, use the null character (ASCII value 0) as the
character byte when drawing the pieces and game board to the screen.
<p>
Double buffering is a common technique used in animation.  To perform double buffering, you 
create a buffer in memory the size of the image you want to draw (in our case the entire 
screen), do all of your drawing of the next frame of the animation on the buffer, 
and then copy the buffer to the screen when the entire frame is drawn.  This helps eliminate
flicker and provides smooth animation of objects on the screen. The BackBuffer variable
has been set up as the buffer to which you will do all of your drawing.

<h3>Asynchronous I/O</h3>
In previous MPs, we used the library's <tt>kbdin/kbdine</tt> functions to
get user input.  These functions continuously polled the keyboard until they
received input.  In many cases, we want our programs to accept input from
other devices and/or execute other functions while waiting for
user input.  This is done by writing our own interrupt service routines (ISRs).
For this MP, you will need to write two ISRs, one for the keyboard and one
for the system timer.  ISRs are discussed in lectures 13 through 16.  Refer
to these lectures and chapter 9 of the lab manual for information on how
to create your own ISRs.

<h3>Gameplay</h3>
The playing field is represented as a two-dimensional array, 23x14 in size, and is 
stored in the GameBoard variable.  There is a border of size 1 around all four sides of the playing
field, the walls are of size 1, and the space in which the pieces can move is 20x10.
Each of the 7 pieces is also represented as a two-dimensional array, 4x4 in size, and they are 
collectively stored in the Pieces variable.
These arrays contain both zero and non-zero values.  Zero values in the Pieces array correspond
to unused cells in representing the piece, and zero values in the GameBoard array indicate cells
in where parts of pieces are not contained.  Non-zero values for both arrays
correspond to parts of pieces and/or the playing field walls, and the non-zero value is the
color byte used to display the piece part on the screen.  Also, the CurrentPiece, NextPiece, and TempPiece variables will hold one of
the seven pieces at a time.
<p>
In MP2, your flags were separate variables, each taking up a byte in memory.  This is a waste
because you only need one bit for each flag.  In this MP, the GameFlags variable
will hold all of the flags you'll need to implement the game.  So, you must make sure than when
you set or clear a flag that you don't alter the values of the other flags.  This will require
bitwise operations such as <tt>and</tt> and <tt>or</tt>.  Study the truth tables for all bitwise
operations to see how you can set, clear, or toggle only 1 bit of a byte.
<p>
Only pieces that have fallen completely will be stored in the playing field array.  Thus,
the current falling piece will not appear in this array until it stops falling.
You will need to keep track of the X and Y position of the current falling piece within the 
playing field. Variables XPos and YPos will be used to do this.  XPos and YPos represent the upper left-hand corner (offset 0) of the CurrentPiece 
variable.  In the illustration below, the * indicates the array cell to which XPos and YPos refer.  
Zero values in the CurrentPiece array are shown as white squares.
<p>
<center><img src="xposypos.gif" width="192" height="192"></center>
<p>
Note that the X and Y position of the current piece on the playing field is NOT 
the X and Y position of the current piece on the screen.  The playing field starts at screen 
coordinate (0,26), so you will have to offset XPos and YPos by these amounts when
you're drawing the current piece to the BackBuffer.
<p>
You'll have to perform collision checking between the current falling piece and the boundaries
and other pieces in the playing field.  To perform collision checking, you'll need to know the
X and Y position of the current piece, contained in XPos and YPos respectively, the contents
of the CurrentPiece array, and the contents of the GameBoard array.  Loop through each
cell in the CurrentPiece array.  If you encounter a non-zero value, you have found part of the
current piece.  Then, check the corresponding cell in the GameBoard array.  If this value is
also non-zero, then there is a collision between the piece and the playing field, and in this
case you should move the piece back to its original location (reset its XPos and YPos values).
<p>
Illustrations of collision checking are given below.  The asterisks, as above, indicate the upper left-hand corner
of the CurrentPiece value.  The zero values in the GameBoard array are indicated by white squares,
and the zero values in the CurrentPiece array are indicated by gray squares.  Pieces stored
in the playing field overlap the values of the CurrentPiece array for convenience.
<p>
<center>
<img src="nocollision.gif" width="560" height="240"> <br>
In this case, after the piece moves down, all non-zero values in the CurrentPiece array have zero values <br>
for their corresponding cells in the GameBoard array.  Thus no collision occurs, and the piece remains where it is.
<p>
<img src="collision.gif" width="880" height="240"> <br>
When the piece tries to move down again, a collision occurs between the current piece and a piece in the playing field. <br>
So, the piece is moved back to its original location.
<p>
</center>
<p>

<p>
This is the first MP in which you will write your own main function.  This will help you
understand not only how the individual parts of the game work but how to pull them together
in order to get them to work as required.  The pseudocode for MP3Main is as follows:

<ul>
<li>Install ISRs
<li>Initialize game variables
<li>GameLoop:
<ul> 
<li>If the ESC key is pressed, user wants to exit, so end GameLoop.
<li>If current falling piece cannot move down further
<ul>
<li>Store the piece in the playing field array
<li>Clear lines in the field if necessary
<li>Update game stats: level, number of lines cleared, and score
<li>Randomly choose next piece and check to see if this piece can move down.  If not, game is over, so end GameLoop.
</ul>
<li>Draw the wallpaper, playing field, current piece, and stats to the buffer
<li>If user wants to display next piece
<ul>
<li>Draw next piece to screen
</ul>
<li>Copy the buffer to the screen
</ul>
<li>Uninstall ISRs
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Gold Star</h2>
You can earn a gold star on this MP.  To do this, you will need to rewrite your
rotate functions to rotate pieces about their center.  The library's functions
just rotate the piece stored in the CurrentPiece variable as is.  You will need
to determine the center of the current piece and perform your rotation about
that point.

<h2>Hints</h2>
<ul>
<li>When you are testing your program, run the program in full-screen mode because
the game does not run smoothly in a window.  This is done by pressing Alt-Enter in 
a command prompt window. Before running your program full-screen, make sure that
the window size is 80x25.  You can check this setting in the window properties by
right clicking on the title bar.  If it's not, the program will not draw correctly
when run in full-screen mode.
<p>
<li>The LIBMP3 file contains executable library functions for each of the
routines that you need to implement.  
This allows you to run the program and understand how it works before you 
implment it.  You can test your program by stepping through the game and 
making sure the display and comparison functions work correctly.  
You will only receive credit, however, for the routines that you implement yourself. 
<p>
<li>When debugging your code in Codeview, you will find it helpful to use
the memory window to show you the memory location of the file and strings.
You can also use the watch window to keep track of variables in your 
code.
<p>
<li>Do not assume that the file starts at memory location 0.
<p>
<li>You may define new variables and function as needed.
<p>
<li>Be very careful if you call another procedure not to destroy registers
that the calling procedure uses.
<p>
<li>Remember to include function headers for each of your functions!
<p>
<li>Remember to include comments within the functions you write!
<p>
<li>START EARLY!  This MP involves integration of many different concepts.
<p>
<li>Monitor the <a href="news:uiuc.class.ece291">newsgroup</a> for 
clarifications and help.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Functions</h2>

<p>This assignment has twenty-one functions (yes it says twenty-one - you do not
need to adjust your browser or monitor settings). You will receive credit by 
replacing each of the twenty-one functions listed below with your own code.

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ul>
<li>You will begin this MP with the following files:
    <ul>
    <li><tt>MP3.ASM</tt>: Program Framework
    <li><tt>bground.dat</tt>: File containing background Wallpaper
    <li><tt>Makefile</tt>: Specifies how and when programs are assembled
        and linked.
    <li><tt>LIBMP3.LIB</tt>: Library functions for MP3
    <li><tt>LIB291.LIB</tt>: General-purpose library functions
    </ul>
<li>You may copy these files from the network drive to your home directory
    with the following command: <br>
    <tt>xcopy /s V:\ece291\mp3 W:\mp3</tt><br>
    or download the files from this server as <a 
href="mp3.zip">mp3.zip</a> 
<li>Add your code to <tt>MP3.ASM</tt>.
<li>Assemble and link your program by typing<br>
      <tt>nmake</tt><Br>
    This command reads <i>Makefile</i> then invokes MASM and LINK to build 
    an executable program.  
<li>Use CodeView (CV) to find and correct program errors. 
<li>Verify your program operation by testing the
    input test file.  You should alter the test file to check 
    different scenarios with your code.
</ul>

<h2>Final Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Print a copy of the MP3 grading report (<a 
href="mp3grade.html">MP3GR</a>).
   Double-check that your program is ready for demonstration.
  <li>Print MP3.ASM at 4 pages/side.
  <li>Demonstrate your MP3.EXE to a TA or to the instructor.</li>
  <li>Be prepared to answer questions about any aspect of the operation of
   your program. The TAs will not accept an MP if you cannot fully explain
   the operation of your code and details of your implementation. Delayed
   MPs will be subject to late penalties as described in the course
   syllabus (10pts/day).</li>
  <li>The TA will electronically handin a copy of your code.
  <li>Take your printouts to the same TA which approved your demonstration.
    Staple the grading sheet to the front of the MP3.ASM printout.  Be sure
    that your name appears in your code and on the grading sheet.
