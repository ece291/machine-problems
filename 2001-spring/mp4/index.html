<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>In this MP, you will be programming a puzzle game called Gravity Blocks using
high resolution graphics in protected mode.&nbsp; There's no turning back now
and no immunity challenges to save you.&nbsp; Can you survive for three weeks
Everitt Lab eating only the food in the vending machines?&nbsp; Don't worry, it
won't be that bad...<br>
 </P>
<p align=center><img border="0" src="blocks.gif" width="645" height="504"></p>
&nbsp;
<H2>Problem Description</H2>
<p>The rules of Gravity Blocks are simple.&nbsp; Each of the seven game pieces
is composed of four smaller blocks, and each block can be one of
five colors.&nbsp; Randomly generated pieces
fall from the top of the game board, and when a piece hits a block in the
game board, the piece will break apart, and its individual blocks will fall
further down the game board if possible.&nbsp; You need to place the pieces in
the game board such that matching three (or more) blocks of the same color
vertically, horizontally, or diagonally will first clear those blocks from the
board and then cause the blocks resting on top of the cleared blocks (if any) to
fall down.&nbsp; This process of clearing and dropping blocks continues until no
more blocks need to be cleared.&nbsp; Thus, by dropping only one piece on to the
game board, you can set off a sequence of cleared blocks. The object of the game is to clear as many blocks as
possible.&nbsp; When the blocks in the game board reach the top, the game is
over.</p>
<p>You will be implementing the game by doing the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Writing code for <a href="pmode.html">protected mode</a></li>
  <li>Displaying the game in <a href="hiresgraph.html">high resolution graphics</a></li>
  <li>Drawing <a href="alphatext.html"> anti-aliased text</a> with alpha
    blitting</li>
  <li>Moving the game pieces with the <a href="input.html">keyboard and mouse</a></li>
  <li>Designing <a href="gameplay.html">gameplay</a> logic such as collision
    checking</li>
</ul>
<H2>Functions</H2>
<P>This assignment has thirty (30) functions. You will receive credit by 
replacing each of the thirty functions listed below with your own code.&nbsp;
All the functions are C-style functions (parameters on stack, return value in
eax/ax/al, all general purpose registers other than esi and edi may be
clobbered). A function that does not take any parameters will be denoted as <b>void</b>
within the parentheses. A parameter name prefixed with an asterisk ( * ) means it is a
pointer, otherwise this parameter is an actual value.&nbsp; The size of the parameters will be denoted as <b>short</b>
which represents a word (2 bytes) and <b>long</b> represents a double word (4
bytes).&nbsp; A function that does not return a value will be declared as <b>void</b>,
otherwise the size of return value will be specified using the previously
mentioned scheme.&nbsp;

          <LI>In main game loop (in no particular order):
            <ul>
              <li>When a piece cannot move down further, clear all the blocks
                and then generate a new piece</li>
              <li>When [_TimerTick] = [_MoveDownTime], move the current piece down
                and update [_MoveDownTime] as follows: add ( 14 - [_Level] ) to
                [_MoveDownTime].&nbsp;
                The speed stops increasing at level 10.&nbsp; So, if the user
                reaches a higher level, the previous update should be done as if
                the user were at level 10.</li>
              <li>Update the screen when a new piece is generated, and draw the
                current piece</li>
              <li>Set the &quot;end of game flag&quot; if the blocks pile up to
                the top of the game board</li>
              <li>Loop terminates when either the user pressed ESC or when a new
                piece is generated that collides with blocks in the game board</li>
              <li>Do not unconditionally call _DrawAll in your main game loop as
                this will cause your game to move very slow.&nbsp; Only update
                the screen when necessary, as this is an expensive operation (MovePiece
                and RotatePieceCW already do this - they call _DrawAll only when a piece
                is moved or rotated).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

        </LI>
          <li>In game over loop:

              <li>If user pressed ESC to exit game in above loop, then bypass game
              over loop.&nbsp; Otherwise, just keep updating the screen, drawing
              the current piece, until the user presses ESC.</li>

        <LI>Points: 5 
        <LI>Notes: 
        <UL>
          <LI>You may used the library provided Random function to get your
            random numbers 
          <LI>There are seven game pieces 
          <LI>Once you get a random number for the piece, multiply it by 16 to get your 
          offset of the first position of the piece you have chosen in the 
          Pieces array. Do NOT use the <TT>mul</TT> instruction to do this - 
          there are much cleaner ways to multiply by 16. 
          <LI>If you encounter a 0 in the Pieces array, copy the 0 to the
            CurrentPiece array.&nbsp; Otherwise generate a number for the color
            of the&nbsp; block and copy the block number to the CurrentPiece
            array 
          <LI>There are five block colors, and you will need random numbers
            between 2 and 6 inclusive to choose the block (look at the
            blocks.png file to see why - the five colored blocks are blocks 2
            thru 6 in the file) 
          <LI>The random number generator does not give good sequences of
            numbers when called with a low <i>MaxNum</i>, such as 5.&nbsp; To
            get pieces that have more than one block of the same color, you may
            choose to call the Random function with a somewhat larger value
            (like 6 or 7), and loop until you get a number between 0 and 4 (the
            range when you call Random with 5). 
          <LI>Clear all game flags except the mouse enable flag 
          <LI>Start the current piece off at (XPos,YPos) = (6,1) in the game
            board 
    </LI> 
          <LI>Set [_MoveDownTime] = [_TimerTick] + ( 14 - [_Level] ).&nbsp; The speed stops increasing at level 10.&nbsp; So, if the user
                reaches a higher level, the previous update should be done as if
                the user were at level 10.

        <LI>Calls: None</UL>
<H2>Procedure</H2>
<ul>
  <li>Copy the given MP4 files from the network drive to your home directory
    with the following command:<br>
    <tt>xcopy /s V:\ece291\mp4 W:\mp4</tt><br>
    Alternatively, from home you can download the same files as <a href="http://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece291/mp/mp4/mp4.zip">mp4.zip</a>.<br>
  <li><b>Unlike previous MP's</b>, you need to run V:\ece291\djgpp\djgpp.bat
    before building your program (only once per DOS session).<br>
    Run <tt>make</tt> to build an executable program using the given ECE291
    library functions.&nbsp; You will also need to run ex291 to set up the
    graphics display, again only once per DOS session.<br>
  <li>As with previous MP's, use a text editor to modify the program. As given,
    the program uses LIBMP4 routines to implement all functionality. To receive
    full credit for the assignment, you will need to implement each of the
    subroutines described above with your own code.<br>
  <li>By modifying a few comments, you can mix and match usage of your own code
    and Library routines. You may notice that the LIBMP4 routines contain
    extraneous and difficult-to-read code. They are not meant to be easily
    unassembled!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Checkpoint</h2>
<p>Due to the size of this MP, there will be a checkpoint due one week after it
is assigned.&nbsp; The following functions need to be completed by the
checkpoint, and credit will not be awarded for them after the checkpoint:</p>
<ul>
  <li>_InstallMouse</li>
  <li>_RemoveMouse</li>
  <li>_SetMousePos</li>
  <li>_UpdateMouseVisibility</li>
  <li>_InstallKeyboard</li>
  <li>_RemoveKeyboard</li>
  <li>_KeyboardISR</li>
  <li>	_DrawBlock</li>
  <li>	_DrawGameBoard</li>
  <li>	_DrawCurrentPiece</li>
</ul>
<H2>Final Steps</H2>
<p>1. Demonstrate your MP4.EXE to a TA. You may be asked to recompile and demo
the program.</p>
<p>2. Be prepared to answer questions about any aspect of the operation of your
program. The TAs will not accept an MP if you cannot fully explain your code and
your implementation. Delayed MPs will be subject to late penalties as described
in the course syllabus (20 pts per day).</p>
<p>3. The TA will complete the code submission procedure.</p>
