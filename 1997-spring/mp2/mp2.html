<h2>Introduction</h2>
The <i>Little Professor</i> was a handheld 
device developed by Texas Instruments that helped young
students learn arithmetic by quizing them on basic math operations.
In this machine problem, you will write the firmware 
for a new device, called <tt> </tt>
<i>The Little (Visiting Assistant) Professor</i>, 
that helps older students sharpen their skills by quizing them
on both arithmetic and logical operations.
<p>
This program automatically generates a sequence of ten quiz questions.
Each question is in the form of:
<blockquote>
<i>Question: Num1 Operation Num2 = Result</i>
</blockquote>
The numbers (Num1 and Num2) and the operation are randomly chosen 
by the program.  For each of the questions asked, the program calculates 
the correct answer
and compares this to the result provided by the user.  If the numbers
match, the user is awarded a point.  If the results differ, the program
displays the correct result but awards no points.  At the end
of the program, the user is shown his or her score and is
prompted to play again.

<h2>Problem Description</h2>

    The program supports multiple levels of difficulty.
    Smaller numbers generated are generated at easy levels and
    larger numbers are generated at more difficult levels.
    A public, word-sized variable called <i>level</i> is read from the user
    when the program begins.
    The procedure <i>PickNum</i> and <i>PickOp</i> use 
    modulo arithmetic with the variable <i>level</i> to
    limit the range of the result.
    <p> 
    For each question, the program randomly selects  a mathematical
    or logical operation.
    At the level 0, only one of the 
    four basic arithmetic operations can appear { + - * / }.
    At all other levels, the program can also include 
    the operations { % & | ^ } for the modulus operation (remainder),
    logical AND, logical OR, and logical XOR. 

<h2>Sample Output</h2>
<ul>
<li>Before you begin, be sure that you fully understand the assignment.
    Perhaps the best way to understand how the program  works is 
    to watch it operate.  
    Visit the lab or download the code
    and run the library-based MP2.EXE.
    Try the game at different levels.  Hit 'ESC' at any time to quit.

<h2>Implementation</h2>
The structure for this machine problem has already been defined to 
consist of the subroutines listed below. 
Once you understand the structure of the program, begin by coding the MAIN
routine. 
There are library routines for all functions.   You are encouraged
to use these functions while you are debugging your code.
<p>
Once you have coded your own MAIN routine, you may write 
the other routines in any order that you wish.  
For all procedures, input and output values are passed to and from 
the procedures via registers.
If a register is not specified as an output, its value 
should not be altered by the routine.  Use the stack to push
and pop registers.

<ul>
<li><b>Main</b><br>
  <ul>
  <li>Using the routines described below, Implement the following
      pseudocode in assembly:
      <p>

     PickOp     ; Randomly select operation in {+,-,*,/,%,&,|,^}
     PIckNum    ; Ramdomly generate second number (Repeat if Zero)
     ShowOp     ; Prompt the user with the question
     CalcResult ; Compute Correct Answer as DX = AX (op=BL) DX

<li><b>Random</b><br>
  <ul>
  <li>Inputs: None 
  <li>Outputs: AX=Random number between 0 .. 2^16-1
  <li>Uses and modifieds variable: <i>RandSeed</i>
  <li>Summary: <p>
    This routine generates and returns a pseudo-random number 
    by multiplication and addition of large prime constants
    to a random number.  The function is defined below:

      <blockquote><i>R(1)=RandSeed <br> R(i+1) = RandSeed = ( K1 * R(i) + K2 ) 
       % MaxValue </i></blockquote>
    Where
     <ul>
     <li><i>R(i)</i> is the random value generated in the <i>i</i>-th call 
         to the subroutine.   
     <li><i>RandSeed</i> is a variable that holds the initial random value
         and is updated with the result after each call to <i>Random</i>.  
     <li><i>K1</i> and K2 are two large, prime-valued constants, defined as
         55821 and 1 respectively.
     <li><i>MaxValue</i> = 2^16-1 (0FFFFh)
     </ul> 
    Hints & Observations
     <ul>
     <li>The first call to <i>Random</i> returns the original random number seed
     <li>Perform multiplication and division
         using the 16-bit unsigned operations.  
     </ul>
   </ul>
<p> 

<li><b>PickNum</b><br>
  <ul>
  <li>Inputs: None
  <li>Outputs: AX=Random number between 0 .. Range
  <li>Uses Variable: <i>Level</i>
  <li>Calls Routine: <i>Random</i>
  <li>Summary: <p>
     This routine returns a random number with a probability
     density function evenly distributed over 0 .. <i>Range</i>.
     <i>Range</i> is determined as a function of <i>Level</i>.
     <i>Range</i> is smaller for easy levels and larger
      for more difficult levels.  
    Specifically, <i>Range</i> should be determined as follows: <p>

    <table border=1>
    <Tr><th>Level</th>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Range</th>
    <tr><td>0<td>Simple<td>       0..   9</tr>

    <tr><td>4<td>ECE291ish<td>    0.. 181</tr>
    </table><p>
  
    Hints
    <ul>
    <li>Use the modulus operation and the <i>Random</i> routine.
    </ul> 
  </ul>      
<p> 

<li><b>PickOp</b><br>
  <ul>
  <li>Inputs: None
  <li>Outputs: BL=ASCII code for Randomly-chosen operation 
  <li>Uses Variable: <i>Level</i>
  <li>Calls Routine: <i>Random</i>
  <li>Summary: <p>
     This routine returns the ASCII value of
     a randomly-chosen operation.  When <i>Level=0</i>,
     the return value should be a random element in the
     set of { + - * / }.  For more difficult levels, 
     the set of possible operations should also include
     { % & | ^ }.  
  </ul>
<p> 

<li><b>CalcResult</b><br>
  <ul>
  <li>Inputs
     <ul>
     <li>AX=Num1
     <li>BL=ASCII-coded operation
     <li>DX=Num2
   </ul>
  <li>Outputs: DX = Result of Num1 (operation) Num2
  <li>Summary: <p>
     This procedure performs the operation
     specified by BL on the numbers Num1 and Num2. <br>
     The possible values of BL and their corresponding
     operations are summarized below:

     <li>BL=ASCII-coded operation
     <li>CX=Qnum
     <li>DX=Num2
   </ul>
  <li>Outputs: None
  <li>Summary: <p>

  This routine prints a message in the format of:

  <blockquote>
  <tt>Question </tt><i>Qnum</i><tt>: </tt><i>Num1 operation Num2</i>
      <tt> = </tt>
  </blockquote>
  Refer to the sample output for examples.

  <ul>
  <li>Inputs: None (Reads keyboard)
  <li>Outputs: AX=Number
  <li>Calls Routines: Kbdin, Dspout
  <li>Summary: <p>

  This routine reads a number from the keyboard.  Your routine
  must be as robust as the library routine given in LIBMP2.  
  Specifically, <i>ReadNum</i> must: <p>
  <ul>
  <li>Process the backspace key (ASCII 8) to delete a character
  <li>Allow for the input of negative ('-') numbers 
  <li>Reject invalid user input.
  <li>Call MP2XIT if ESC is pressed
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>

<li><b>CMPResult</b><br>
  <ul>
  <li>Inputs: 
    <ul>
    <li>AX=User's Answer
    <li>DX=Computer's Answer
    </ul>
  <li>Outputs: None
  <li>Uses and modifieds variable: <i>Score</i>
  <li>Summary: <p>
     If the user's answer equals the computer's answer, the routine
      increments score and prints: <br>
     <tt>Correct !</tt><br>
     Otherwise, the computer displays: <br>
     <tt>Incorrect.  The answer is: </tt><i>Result</i><br> 
     where <i>Result</i> is the computer's answer.  <br>
     See the sample output or run the game for examples.
  </ul>

</ul>

<h2>Program Assignment</h2>
  You will begin this machine problem with a fully functional 
  program.  The main program is given below.  I have provided the
  library routines for each of the subroutines.  You will
  score points by replacing each library procedures with your own code.
  Your score will be proportional to the percentage of the code
  that you write yourself.  The breakdown in points is given below:
  Your routine MUST perform all functions of the subroutine to 
  obtain credit.
  <ul>
  <li>Main: 10 pts
  <li>Random: 5 pts
  <li>PickNum: 5 pts
  <li>PickOp: 5 pts
  <li>ShowOp: 5 pts
  <li>ReadNum: 7 pts
  <li>CalcResult: 8 pts
  <li>CMPResult: 5 pts
  </ul>  




<h2>Preliminary Procedure</h2>
<ul>
<li>Copy the empty MP2.ASM framework, Makefile, 
    sample output, library files (LIBMP2.LIB and LIB291.LIB),
    and library-based MP2.EXE from the network drive 
    to your home directory with the following command: <br>
    <tt>xcopy /s E:\ece291\mp2 F:\mp2</tt>
<li>Alternatively, if you are working from home,
    click below to download<br> <a href="mp2.zip">mp2.zip</a> 
<li>You can Assemble and link your program with 
    the <tt> nmake</tt> command.  
</ul>


<h2>Final Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Demonstrate MP2.EXE to a TA or to the instructor.  
    You will be asked to reassemble and demonstrate 
    MP2 for all levels for multiple runs. 
<li>Because the <i>Random</i> Routine uses a fixed seed, your
    program should choose the exact same operations as the 
    library version.
<li>Have the TA execute the handin program from your machine.
<li>Print MP2.ASM and give it to  
    to the same TA which approved your 
    demonstration.  Be sure that your name appears in your program.
</ol>

COMMENT *
        The Little (Visiting Assistant) Professor

        This program automatically generates quiz questions to
        teach basic arithmetic.  Both the numbers and the operations
        are randomly chosen.  For each of the ten questions asked,
        the program calculates the correct answer and compares this
        to the user's response.  If the answers match, the user is
        awarded a point.  The premis of this program is based
        on a handheld device called 'The Little Professor' by
        Texas Instruments.
