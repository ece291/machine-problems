<h2>Introduction</h2>
In the first part of MP5, we developed procedures
to read a bitmapped image from a file, store the data into memory,
and display an image to the VGA screen.  
For <i>part II</i> of MP5, we will complete the game of <i>Network Tag</i>
by adding network play, joystick control, and game play algorithms.
Network tag can be played with up 63 players simultaneously.  
<p>
We each represent ourself in the game with our unique bitmapped image. 
When we enter the game, we transmit our 32x32, 16-color, BMP image
to everyone else in the game within a HELLO message.  
Upon receiving a HELLO message, other players
store our image into a variable called <i>ImageArray</i> and note that we
are active by updating a flag in the <i>Player</i> variable.
Once every two seconds, we retransmit our HELLO message to reach new players 
that may have just entered the game.
<p>
We control our movement via the joystick.  
Each time we read our
joystick, we update our position and transmit an UPDATE message to
the other players in the game.  
We learn of the positions
of other players by listening to the network.  
We each store information from other players in our local <i>Player</i>
variable.
Positions are specified as an offset on a mode-13 VGA screen.  
Our movements are limited to within
the perimeter of the 320x200-pixel screen.  
<p>
When the game first begins, one player may become <i>it</i> by pressing the 
lower fire button on the joystick.  For the rest of the game, 
<i>It</i>  is transferred by contact with another player.  
when we become <i>it</i>, we cannot <i>tag back</i> 
the player that just touched us.  Additional fields in the UPDATE message
are used to control the <i>it</i> protocol.
<p>
We can leave the game at any time by pressing both buttons on the joystick.
Just before we exit, we send a GOODBYE message to the other players in
the game to let them know we are no longer active in the game.


<h2>Network Protocol</h2>
As described above, there are three
types of messages are exhanged between players: HELLO, UPDATE, and GOODBYE.
All messages begin with a byte that identifies the message type.
The next byte of the message identifies the player that sent the message.
The rest of the bytes contain the message data.
The structure definitions for these messages are 
given at the beginning MP5.ASM.  
<p>
Multicast Datagrams are used to transmit messages among players.
All Messages are sent to a NetBIOS group called <i>ECE291MP5</i> are received
by all players in the game.  When a player first joins they game, they
are given the first available name between 
<i>ECE291Player00</i> and <i>ECE291Player63</i>.  
<p>
To simplify the programming for NetBIOS, you have been given NETLIB.LIB --
a library which provides function calls to send and receive datagrams.
The NetLIB library calls are summarized below.
Additional documentation about NetBIOS and Lockwood's NetLIB functions 
can be found on our 
<a href="http://www.ece.uiuc.edu/~ece291/class-resources/">ECE291 
Class Resources</a> Web Page.
<p>
<blockquote><font size=-1><xmp>
NetInit:    Initializes Network - Returns: Player num in AL
SendPacket: Transmits data in TXBuffer - Inputs: AX = Length
NetRelease: Release network resources 

netpost : Procedure called when datagram arrives.
          Called with AX = Length, BX = Pointer to RXBuffer
          Must preserve all registers modified
          Ends with RET (not IRET)

TXBuffer: Transmit Buffer (1024 bytes) - Write your data here 
RXBuffer: Receive Buffer  (1024 bytes) - Read from here !
</xmp></font></blockquote>

<h2>Important Variables</h2>

To understand how network tag operates, consider 
the information stored at each node.

<ul>
<li><b>Player:</b> 64-element array of PlayerType. <br>
       Stores position and status of remote users.  <br>
       Modified when packets arrive and used to redraw the screen.
<li><b>ImageArray:</b> 64-element array of 1024-byte, uncompressed images.<br>
       Holds local copy of remote user images.
<li><b>MyNum</b>: My player number (as determined by NetINIT)
<li><b>ItNum</b>: The number of the player that I think is it.
<li><b>TagNum</b>: The number of the player that tagged me
<li><b>MyPosition</b>: My location on the screen
</ul>
<h2>Problem Assignment </h2>
To help you save time, I have given you the source code for the main 
procedure.   This code controls the flow of the game and
transmits packets to the other players in the game.  
It is your job to first read and understand this code.
You will then complete the program
using your own routines from parts I and II of this MP.
<p>
You may cut & paste your graphic routines from Part I's 
MP5GR.ASM into Part II's MP5.ASM.  
Edit MP5.ASM to add your new procedures for 
joystick control, data reception, and updating the screen.





<h2>Network, Joystick, and Screen Routines</h2>
<ul>
<li><i>All routines should preserve the values of
       any registers modified</i>
<li><i>Use proper segments where needed</i><p>

<li><font size=+2><b>JoyCalibrate</b></font>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> Calibrate joystick. 
  <li><b>Input: </b> Joystick status register
  <li><b>Output: </b> Variables of your choosing
  <li><b>Description:</b> 
     This routine is called at the beginning of the program to calibrate
     the position of the joystick and compensate for the variations 
     in resistance typically found between different hardware devices.
     Assume that the stick is in the middle position when the routine
     is called.
  </ul><p>

<li><font size=+2><b>JoyStickMove</b></font>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> Read and process commands from the joystick
  <li><b>Variables Used: </b> Values set by JoyCalibrate 
    <ul>
    <li>MyPosition: Allow player to move up, down, left, or right <br>
        (but not outside perimeter of the screen)
    <li>ItNum/TagNum: Set ItNum=MyNum and TagNum=63 if button 0 pressed <br>
        (allow me to become <i>it</i>)
    <li>ExitFlag: Set ExitFlag=1 if both joystick buttons are pressed <Br>
        (allow program to exit)
    </ul>
  </ul><p>

<li><font size=+2><b>ReDrawScreen</b></font>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> Redraw the screen with up to 63 players
  <li><b>Array Variable Used: </b> Player
  <li><b>Output: </b> Writes directly to screen
  <li><b>Calls Functions: </b> DrawBox, DrawEmptyBox, DrawBMP
  <li><b>Description</b>: 
    Redraw each ACTIVE player on the screen at their current position.<br>
    Outline the player with an empty box when they are <i>it</i>. <br>
    If a player is DEPARTING, remove their image and set their staus
    to INACTIVE.

   </ul><p>

<li><font size=+2><b>NetPost</b></font>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> Process Incoming Datagrams 
  <li><b>Array Variables Modified: </b> Player
  <li><b>Output registers: </b> None! (processed within an interrupt)
  <li><b>Calls Functions: </b> StoreBMP 
  <li><b>Description</b>: The NetPost function is called by 
        NetLIB whenever a datagram
        arrives.  The actions taken depend on the message type.
        <ul>
        <li>HELLO: Set the player status to active
            and store their image to the array.
        <li>UPDATE: 
          <ul>
          <li>Update the player's current position. <br>
          <li>If some other player is <i>it</i> AND that player 
              overlapping me AND that player wasn't tagged by me, 
               then I should become <i>it</i>.
               (ItNum=MyNum, TagNum=PlayerNum). <br>
          <li>If some other player is <i>it</i> AND that player 
              is NOT overlapping me
               then let him/her become <i>it</i>
                (ItNum=PlayerNum). <br>
          <li>If some other player is <i>it</i> AND that player 
               was tagged by me, let him/her continue to be <i>it</i> 
               then let him/her become <i>it</i>
                (ItNum=PlayerNum). <br>
           </ul>
        <li>UPDATE: Set the player status to departing.
              Let the ReDrawScreen take care of removing
              the user from the screen.
        </ul>

  <li><b>Hints:</b>
     <ul>
     <li>You will receive messages from yourself
     </ul>

    </ul>
  </ul><p>
