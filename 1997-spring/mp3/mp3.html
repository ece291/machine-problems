<h2>Introduction</h2>

        A wedding is planned in the town of Hanoi, Illinois.
        For the event, a baker has prepared an elaborate
        wedding cake with multiple tiers.  Each tier of the cake is a
        different size.  Initially, the cake is stacked at the bakery
        with the largest tier at the bottom and progressively smaller
        cakes stacked above one another.  Using manual labor and the bakery's
        single delivery truck, a plan is needed to transport the
        entire cake to the recepton.  A diagram is shown below:
<p>
<center><img src="hanoi-bakery.gif" width="330" height="78"></center>
<p>
        The baker must transport the entire cake to the reception.
        Because the cake is heavy, it must be moved one tier at a time.
        To insure that the cakes are not damaged before the reception, the
        cake tiers must always be kept at the bakery, in the delivery van,
        or on the table at the reception.   Tiers of cake can be 
        moved directly between all three locations.
        Tiers of the cake may be stacked,
        but a larger tier must never be placed atop a smaller one for fear
        of collapsing the smaller tier. 
       
<p>
        The baker's delivery man, Igor, has already moved some of the
        tiers of cake.  Wrought with confusion and frustration from moving
        the cake, Igor has called the baker and quit his job.  With the
        wedding reception only hours away, the baker is desparate to find
        someone to get all of the cakes to the reception and stacked in the
        proper order. 
<p>
        As a student of ECE291, the baker has hired you to help him
        devise a plan to start where Igor left the tiers and assemble the cake
        at the reception as efficiently as possible.

<h2>Implementation</h2>
        For this machine problem, you will write a program which:
<ul>
         <li> Graphically displays cake tiers at the bakery,
           on the van, and at the reception using text-mode video.
         <li> Simulates Igor's activity by randomly distributing
           tiers of cake to each location.
         <li> Allows a user to manually move tiers of cake
           between locations via the mouse.
         <li>Automatically transfer
            all tiers of the cake to the reception using the
            least number of transfers 
            starting with any number of tiers
            in any given arrangement.
</ul>       
<center><img src="hanoi-screen.gif" width="642" height="302"></center>
<p>
A screen dump of the running program is shown above.  Along the top
of the screen are a series of buttons.  Each of these buttons responds to
a mouse-click.  Just below the buttons, the program displays the current
number of moves as well as the number of tiers of cake.  The lower portion
of the screen contains the bakery, the delivery truck, and reception.
To win the game, the entire cake should be moved to the reception
(the right-most location).

<h2>Usage Instructions</h2>

The library-based MP3.EXE demo can be run from the DOS prompt.
Use the mouse to press the on-screen buttons and 
move tiers of cake between locations.  Tiers are moved by moving the
mouse to the source, pressing the mouse button, moving the mouse
to the destination, then releasing the mouse button.  The program
will not allow larger tiers of cake to be placed atop smaller tiers.
If the mouse does not appear on your screen, enter
<i>mouse</i> to load your mouse driver.  
This program should operate both in full-screen text-mode and within a 
window.

<h2>Data Structures </h2>

The following variables are used throughout the program and by
the library functions.  

<ul>
<li><b>Tiers:</b>
  This word-sized variable stores the number of tiers in the current game.
A Larger number of tiers makes the game more difficult.
By default, the game begins with 4 tiers.  The value can 
be changed from 1 to 10 by clicking on the <tt>More Tiers</tt> or 
<tt>Less Tiers</tt> buttons.  <p>

<li><b>Moves:</b>
  A word-sized variable that tracks the number of valid moves.  It
is reset to zero whenever the game is reset or the tiers are distibuted.
It is incremented on every valid move.  <p>

<li><B>Bakery, Truck, Recept:</b>
Bit-mapped vectors are used to determine which tiers appear at each location.
Three words, <tt>Bakery, Truck, Recept</tt> are used to determine which
tiers are located at the bakery, on the delivery van, or at the the reception.
The least-significant bit (bit 0) of each word corresponds to the largest
tier.  For a game with four tiers, for example, a value of 1 in the 
0th bit position of <tt>recept</tt> would indicate that the largest 
tier of the 4-tier cake is already at the reception.  You may
find the following observations useful:
<ul>
<li>A word-sized variable can represent all possible permuations
    of tiers at any given location.
<li>The order of tiers at each location is implicit.
    Larger tiers are always at the bottom.  
<li>The number of '1's in the bit-vector corresponds to the number
    of tiers at a given location.
<li>The three variables starting with <tt>Bakery</tt>
    are located in six consecutive bytes of memory.

  </ul>
</ul>



<h2>Procedures </h2>
The ASM procedures that you need to implement are described below.
There are working library versions of each of these procedures in
<i>libmp3.lib</i>.  Unless otherwise noted, it is expected that
all routines will preserve the value of any register modified
other than the output.
<p>
You are encouraged to write your own procedures to handle repetive 
tasks.  You will find, for example, that a function which
writes messages on the screen at given location can be used throughout
your program.  
<p>
Be sure that you have experimented with the library-based program before
you begin.  It is important that you fully understand the problem before
you try to write the code.  Because library functions call other 
library functions, you are encouraged to begin coding with the MAIN routine.  
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>DrawScreen</b>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> 
      Displays all text, menu buttons, and graphics shown on the screen
      above.  
  <li><b>Assumes:</b> ES = VidTxtSeg (B800)
  <li><b>Variables Used:</b> <tt>Tiers, Moves, Bakery, Truck, Recept</tt>
  <li><b>Description</b>:<p>
     This routine is responsible for drawing the contents
     of the screen. The routine should display messages on the screen
     current values of <tt>tiers</tt> and <tt>moves</tt>; and 
     graphically represent the contents of <tt>bakery</tt>,
     <tt>truck</tt>, and <tt>recept</tt> as a stacked tiers of blue cake.
     Your screen should, at minimum, match the screen generated by
     the library function (though you
     are welcome to exercise artistic freedom and
     creating a more elaborate screen).<p>
  <li><b>Hint:</b>: It is worthwhile to write subroutines to 
     avoid duplication of code for repetive tasks.  It is up to 
     you to decide how best to implement such routines.
  <li><b>Hint:</b>: An ASCII table appears on page 149 of your lab manual.
  </ul><p>

<li><b>ReDrawScreen</b>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b>
      Incrementally update the screen after a movement.
  <li><b>Description:</b>
     This routine updates the contents of the screen after moving 
     a tier.  It should only write to the areas of the screen 
     that are changed when a tier is moved.
     The new value of <tt>Moves</tt> should be displayed and
     the graphic display of the cake should be refreshed.
  <li><b>Variables Used:</b> <tt>Moves, Bakery, Truck, Recept</tt>
  <li><b>Hint:</b>: This code may use some of the same subroutines   
     as DrawScreen
  </ul><p>

<li><B>ResetGame</b>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b>
    Places all tiers of cake at the bakery.
  <li><b>Variables Used:</b> <tt>Tiers, Bakery, Truck, Recept</tt>
  <li><b>Description</b>:<p>
    This function is called when the game is reset or when the
    number of tiers are modified.
  </ul> <p>

<li><b>Distribute</b>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> 
     Randomly distribute tiers of cake among the locations
  <li><b>Variables Used:</b> <tt>Tiers, Bakery, Truck, Recept</tt>
  <li><b>Description:</b><p>
     Simulates the activity of Igor by randomly distributing the
     Tiers of cake between the locations.  
     You may need to modify your random call from MP2
     to obtain well-distributed values (hint: avoid multipication
     by a power of 3).  It is <i>not</i> necessary to exactly
     match the random pattern generated by the library function.
  </ul> <p>

<li><b>MoveTier</b>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> 
     Moves one tier of cake from SI to DI.
  <li><b>Variables Used:</b> <tt>Moves, Bakery, Truck, Recept</tt>
  <li><b>Inputs</b>
    <ul>
    <li>SI: Source location  (0=bakery, 1=truck, 2=reception)
    <li>DI: Destination location (0=bakery, 1=truck, 2=reception)
    </ul>
  <li><b>Outputs:</b> Returns AX=1 if a move was made, 0 otherwise.
  <li><b>Description</b>:<p>
    This routine moves a tier of cake from the source to the destination.
    The bitmapped vectors for the bakery, truck, and/or reception should
    be modified, <tt>moves</tt> should be incremented,
    and AX should return 1 if the move was valid.  
    If the move was invalid (i.e., the user tried to move a larger
    tier atop a smaller tier), the program should print an error message
    at the bottom of the screen, beep, and return AX=0.
</ul> <p>

<li><b>AutoSolve</b>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> 
    Automatically delivers all tiers of cake to the reception.
  <li><b>Variables Used:</b> <tt>Tiers, Bakery, Truck, Recept</tt>
  <li><b>Calls Function:</b> MoveTier
  <li><b>Inputs:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>DI: Target destination = {0,1,2}
    <li>CX: Tier Level = {1..Tiers} 
    </ul>
  <li><b>Initial Recursive Call:</b>
     <ul>
     <li>To solve the entire puzzle, Autosolve is invoked with <br>
     CX=1 (the largest tier at the right-most bit position)   and<br>
     DI=2 (destination location = reception)
     </ul>
  <li><b>Description:</b><p>
     The classic 'Towers of Hanoi' problem is solved recursively
     via a divide-and-conquer algorithm.  The solution to the single-tier
     problem is trivial--the tier can be moved directly to the reception.
     When all tiers originate at one location (the bakery), the problem
     can be solved recursively as follows:
     <ol>
     <li>Move the (N-1) smaller tiers from the current location of the Nth 
         tier to a location different than the destination.
     <li>Move the Nth tier to the destination.
     <li>Move the smaller (N-1) tiers to the destination.
     </ol>
     The first and third steps of the algorithm are recursive.
     They call <tt>Autosolve</tt> with CX=(CX+1) and DI set to
     the destination needed by the current step.   The solution divides
     the problem into two sub-problems of size (N-1) 
     and the single-tier problem of moving the Nth plate to its destination.
     With two tiers, the solution requires 3 steps.  For three tiers,
     the solution requires 3+1+3=7 steps. 
     In general, the number of moves required to solve a problem 
     with N tiers is equal to 2^n-1.  
     <p>
     To solve the problem
     when the tiers are randomly distributed, one extra step is required.
     If the Nth tier is <i>already</i> located at the correct location,
     the program skips steps one and two.
     <p>
     To control the speed of AutoSolve, the user must provide a keypress
     just before each tier movement.  While
     AutoSolve is running, a blinking message should appear at
     the bottom of the screen.
  </ul><p>

<li><b>MouseCtrl</b>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b>
    Generate a return code when "buttons" are pressed or a tier is moved.
  <li><b>Output</b>AX=command, SI=source, DI=destination 
  <li><b>Description</b>
    The mouse allows the user to press buttons and move objects on the
    screen.  For this MP, the "buttons" are the messages with the
    red background near the top of the screen.  When the user clicks
    the left mouse atop or near a button, this routine returns
    a number in AX.  The buttons are numbered from left to right
    with the values 0 to 5.  When the user moves a tier, this routine should
    return the source and destination locations in registers SI and DI
    and set AX=6.  
    Tiers are moved by placing the mouse on the source, pressing the
    left mouse button, moving the mouse to the destination, then releasing
    the button. 
    SI and DI should be encoded as: 0=bakery, 1=truck, and 2=recept.
    <p>
  <li><b>Notes</b></b>
    <ul>
  <li>The program spends most of the time in the MouseCtrl routine.
    The program loops in this routine until the user has either clicked
    a button or finished a movement (i.e., held and released the mouse button).
  <li>The mouse status is read via software interrupts.  By
    loading the appropriate values into registers and executing 
    <tt>INT 33h</tt>, the location of
    the mouse and the status of the buttons can be determined.
  <li>The mouse interrupt functions are
    documented in Sections 10.2 of the lab manual (pages 87-90).
  <li>Notice that the mouse is initialized and made
    visible in main.  You need not repeat this code.
  <li>To use the mouse in DOS, you must
    install the mouse driver.  On most machines, you
    need only type 'MOUSE'.  
  <li>You may need to run the program
    in full-screen mode (hit [ALT-ENTER] in win95).
  </ul>
</ul><p>

<li><b>Main</b>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b>
    Invoke the procedures described above.
  <li><b>Description:</b><p>
    The main program begins by setting ES=VidTxtSeg, 
    calling distribute to create the first game, 
    calling drawscreen to show the initial screen,
    then using INT 33h to initialize the mouse.  
    <p>
    The rest of the main program contains an infinite loop that
    calls <i>MouseCtrl</i> to read the user's command.  Based on
    the return value of AX (0..6), the appropriate procedure(s)
    should be called.  
  </ul>

</ul> <!-- End of procedures -->

<h2>Program Assignment</h2>
You earn points by replacing each subroutine with your own code.
Your score will be proportional to the percentage of the code that
your write yourself.  The breakdown in points is given below.  Your
routine MUST perform all functions of the subroutine to receive credit.

<ul>
<li>DrawScreen: 10 pts.
<li>ReDrawScreen: 3 pts.
<li>ResetGame: 2 pts.
<li>Distribute: 3 pts.
<li>MoveTier: 5 pts.
<li>AutoSolve: 12 pts.
<li>MouseCtrl: 7 pts.
<li>Main: 8 pts.
<li>Up to 15 points may be deducted for poor modularity, 
    lack of comments, and/or
    poor programming style, as described in the course syallabus.
</ul>


<h2>Preliminary Procedure </h2> 
<ul>
<li>You will begin MP3 with the following files:
    <ul>
    <li><tt>MP3.EXE</tt>: The fully functional program using library functions
    <li><tt>MP3.ASM</tt>: Program Framework
    <li><tt>LIBMP3.LIB</tt>: Working versions of all routines
    <li><tt>LIB291.LIB</tt>: Useful (and free) routines 
    <li><tt>Makefile</tt>
    </ul>

<li>You can obtain these files via one of the methods listed below:
  <ul>
  <li>In lab, copy all files to your directory with the following command:<br>
      <tt>xcopy /s E:\ECE291\MP3\ F:\MP3</tt>
  <li>At home, download all files as: <a href="mp3.zip">MP3.ZIP</a>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Clearifications and Erratica </h2> 
<ul>
  <li>Main should processes return values of AX=0..6 from MouseCtrl
  <li>MouseCtrl should check that status of the mouse when the routine is
      called.  If the button is initially pressed; it should wait for
      a release.  This will avoid looping though main.
 
</ul>
