<h2>Introduction</h2>
Life is full of events.  Between assignments, meetings, birthdays,
and anniversaries, it is easy to forget about an important event.
A single semester of ECE291, for example, has over a dozen deadlines 
just for homeworks and machine problems.  To remember events,
it helps to be warned of those that have deadlines approaching
in the near future.

<h2>Problem Description</h2> 
For this machine problem, you are to complete an assembly program
which scans a list of events and reports those that have 
deadlines within a given number of days in the future.  

<p>
For this machine problem, you are given:
<ul>
<li>A list of events defined as an array variable in memory.
<li>A variable called <i>lookahead</i> which determines how many days in
    advance the calendar should be searched.
<li>LIBMP1 function to read the current month and day from the system clock
<li>LIBMP1 function to print a date in "MM/DD" format
<li>LIBMP1 function to calculate a day number from a given month/day
<li>LIB291 functions to display output on the screen.
</ul>

Your program is required to:
<ul>
<li>Output data in the same format as the <i>sample output</i>
    given later in this assignment.
<li>Print each event for the days between the current date and
    <i>lookahead</i> days in the future.
<li>Operate for any value of <i>lookahead</i> between 0 and 365.
<li>Operate for any database of arbitrary data and number of records.
<li>Wrap around the calendar at the end of the year.
    If your program were run on 12/25 with the default value of
    <i>lookahead</i>=14, for example, your program should report on events 
    not only through the rest of December, but also on
    events in early January.
<li>Print the events in the same order as they appear in the data file.
<li>Run efficiently.  Points will be deducted for an inefficient algorithm
    and excessive coding.
</ul><p>

<h2>Format of an event</h2>
A structure (abbreviated STRUC) describes to the computer how
your data is represented.  
For MP1, each event is described as a message and a date. 
The message is represented as an ASCII string and the
month and day are represented as byte-sized integers.
The deadline for this machine problem, for example, can be described 
as "MP1 due" on 2/11.  
<p>
The format of the 32-byte Event structure is
summarized below.  In this table 
'B' represents a 1-byte unsigned integer, 'A' represents an ASCII character,
and '$' represents the ASCII character used to mark the end of a string.
By default, <i> message </i> is initialized as a 29-byte array of
blank characters.  The <i>endmark</i> field is always filled with
the '$' character so that <i> message </i> can be easily printed 
with the DSPMSG routine of LIB291.  The <i>offset</i> refers to the starting 
location of each field in the structure.
<p>
<center><table border=1 cellpadding=3>
<tr>
  <th>Field</th>
  <th> month</th>
  <th>day</th>
  <th>message </th>
  <th>endmark</th>
  </tr>
<tr>
  <th>Data</th>
  <td><tt>B</tt></td>
  <td><tt>B</td>
  <td><tt>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</tt></td>
  <td><tt>$</tt></td>
<tr>
  <th>Offset</th>
  <td>0<td>1<td>2<td>31</tr>
</table></center>
<p>
An array of event structures is defined by a variable called <i>events</i>.
The number of events in this array is given by a word-sized 
integer called <i>numrec</i>.

<h2>Sample Output</h2>

</xmp>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ul>
<li>You will begin this MP with the following files:
    <ul>
    <li><tt>MP1.ASM</tt>: Program Framework
    <li><tt>EVENTS.INC</tt>: Events Database
    <li><tt>Makefile</tt>: Specifies how and when programs are assembled
        and linked.
    <li><tt>LIBMP1.LIB</tt>: Library functions for MP1
    <li><tt>LIB291.LIB</tt>: General-purpose library functions
    </ul>
<li>You may copy these files from the network drive to your home directory
    with the following command: <br>
    <tt>xcopy /s E:\ece291\mp1 F:\mp1</tt><br>
    or download the files from this server as <a href="mp1.zip">mp1.zip</a> 
<li>Add your code to <tt>MP1.ASM</tt>.
<li>Assemble and link your program by typing<br>
      <tt>nmake</tt><Br>
    This command reads <i>Makefile</i> then invokes MASM and LINK to build 
    an executable program.  
<li>Use DEBUG or CodeView (CV) to find and correct program errors. 
<li>Verify your program operation by testing with
    different events, dates, and lookahead values.
</ul>

<h2>Final Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Demonstrate MP1.EXE to a TA or to the instructor.  
    You will be asked to recompile and demonstrate 
    MP1 using a different EVENTS.INC file.  
    This file will specify a modified database of events
    and a different lookahead value.  
    Successful completion of your program with different inputs
    will ensure that you followed directions and that your program
    has no hard-coded operations.
<li>Be sure that your name and date appears in the first line of MP1.ASM.
<li>Copy your programs to a floppy using the following command: <br>
    <tt>xcopy /s F:\mp1 a:\mp1</tt> 
<li>Print MP1.ASM 
<li>Take your printout and disk with MP1 to the same TA which approved your 
    demonstration.  
</ol>

COMMENT *
        This program checks a calendar to remind you of
        events that will occur in the near future.
        The data for this program are read from the file
        events.inc when the program is assembled.
        Dates are specified in a month/day format.
