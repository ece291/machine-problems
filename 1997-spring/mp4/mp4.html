<h2>Introduction</h2>
Mankind first visited the moon in 1969.  The lunar lander 
was the vehicle that travelled from orbit to the
surface of the moon.  
<p>
A lunar lander is controlled by rocket engines.
Rocket engines produce a constant force in the opposite direction that
they are fired.  The main truster points in the downward direction 
and is used to counteract the force of gravity.  Side thusters 
control movement in the horizontal direction.
<p>
The goal of this machine problem is gently land your craft
on the surface of the moon.  
Your lander will be damaged or destroyed if you descend too fast.
The craft will also be destroyed if you attemped to land 
on a surface other than the landing pad. 
You will find yourself lost in space if you stray too far away from 
the destination.  Finally, you will lose control of the thrusters if
you run out of fuel.  
<p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

A screen dump of the working library-based version of the program 
that you are to write is shown
below.  The gauges on the left show altitude, velocities, position, and
fuel.   The window on the right shows the position of the craft as it
approaches the surface of the moon.  The small landing pad appears at 
the lower-left corner of the main
of the window.  The screen is drawn using 
extended ASCII characters on a text-mode video screen.

<p>
Interrupts are used to read the keyboard and perform 
real-time calculations at periodic intervals.  
The left, right, and downward arrow keys
are used to control the operations of the thrusters.
By reading scan codes directly
from the keyboard, the program is able to 
decode simultaneous keypresses.  
A Thurster operates at full capacity while the button
is pressed.
<p>
The timer is used to periodically
compute new values of acceleration, velocity, and position.  
The function which performs these calculations 
is chained onto the default 
system timer interrupt vector and called 18 times a second.
<p>
<h2>Physical Equations</h2>
The program tracks the acceleration, velocity, and position of the
lunar lander along both the horizontal and vertical directions.
The lunar lander has a mass of 1000kg.  
The main thruster (T) provides a force of 5000 Newtons. 
Firing the main thruster results in an acceleration of 
5 m/s^2 in the upward direction.  
The left and right side-thrusters (TL and TR) can each produce 
a force of 2000 Newtons.
At all times, the lunar gravitational field
accelerates the lander downward at a rate of
3 meters per second squared (m/s^2).  The net motion of the lander
can be determined by summing the forces.
<p>
Recall that acceleration (A) is the time derivative of
velocity (V) and that position (X) is the time derivative of velocity (V).
For this problem, it is convienient to calculate the piece-wise integral
of acceleration to obtain velocity and the piece-wise integral of
velocity to calculate the position.  Using V<sub>i-1</sub> as the
previous velocity and X<sub>i-1</sub> as the previous postion, 
new values of A, V, and X can be calculated at each instant of time
as shown below:
<blockquote>
A<sub>i</sub> = <i>Sum of forces / Mass</i><br>
V<sub>i</sub> = V<sub>i-1</sub> + A<sub>i</sub> * dt <br>
X <sub>i</sub>= X<sub>i-1</sub> + V<sub>i</sub> * dt 
</blockquote>

<h2>Numeric Representation</h2>
By carefully choosing units for time and position, integer
arithmetic can be used to internally
calculate acceleration, velocity, and position.  
Because the default PC timer interval is 1/18 second,
it is convienient to measure time (dt) in units of 1/18 sec.  
To express acceleration in standard units of m/s^2, distance is
measured in units of 1/18^2=1/324 of a meter.  Using these conventions,
therefore, velocity is measured in units of 1/18 m/s.

<h2>Data Display</h2>
Gauges and graphics are used to display information to the user.
Division is used to display position and velocity
in standard units of m and m/s.  For the diagram of the
lunar lander on the low-resolution text-mode screen, each horizontal
column represents 2 meters and each vertical position represents
4 meters.

<h2>Procedures</h2>
You begin this problem with a set of working, modular procedures 
that together implement the function of the program.  You will earn points by 
writing your own code to implement these procedures.  You are strongly
encouraged to experiment with the library-based <tt>mp4.exe</tt>  
to better understand how the program operates.

<ul>
<li><font size=+2><b>InstTime</b></font><p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> Install the timer interrupt
  <li><b>Description</b>:<br>
    This routines should chain the procedure <i>MyTimeInt</i> into
    list of functions called by IRQ 0.  It should preserve a pointer
    to the original timer vector for use by <i>MyTimeInt</i> and 
    <i>DeInstallTime</i>. 
  <li><b>Notes</b>:<br>
    The library function always installs the library-based
    <i>MyTimeInt</i> routine.
  </ul>
<p>
<xmp>

</xmp>

<li><font size=+2><b>MyTimeInt</b></font><p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> Calculate new acceleration, velocity, position, time,
     and fuel values every 1/18th of a second.
  <li><b>Description</b>:<br>
     <ul>
     <li>As described above, velocity and acceleration are computed as 
         piece-wise integrals.  This routine performs these calculations
         on the periodic interval of the default timer (1/18 of a second).
         The program reads modifieds the variables: <br>
         <tt>x, v_x, a_x, y, v_y, a_y, G, T, TL, </tt> and <tt> TR </tt><Br>
         <i>(see variable section of given mp4.asm)</i>.
     <li><tt>Time</tt> should be incremented each time the procedure is called.
     <li><tt>Fuel</tt> should be decreased by the amount of thrust that
     each thruster is exerting.   If <tt>fuel</tt> runs out, <tt>T, TL, TR</tt>
     should be reset to zero.
     <li><tt>ExitFlag</tt> should be set to <tt>1</tt> if the ship
     touches the ground (y < 0) or gets lost in space (i.e., moves 
     outside the edges of the window on the screen).
    </ul>
  <li><b>Notes</b>:<br>
    <ul>
    <li>Remember that this is an interrupt service rotuine.  Be sure
    to save all registers  and exit with IRET. 
    <li>Review the on-line lecture notes, especially
      <a href="/~ece291/lecture/l14.html">Lecture 14</a> and
      <a href="/~ece291/lecture/l15.html">Lecture 15</a>.
    </ul/>
  </ul>
<p>
<xmp>

</xmp>
<li><font size=+2><b>DeInstallTime</b></font><p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose</b>: Restore original timer vector 
  <li><b>Description:</b> <br>
    This routine should be called just before you exit your program.
    It should restore the default vector for IRQ0.
  </ul>
   <p>

<li><font size=+2><b>InstKey</b></font><p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose</b>: Install a new keyboard handler.
  <li><b>Description:</b> <br>
     This function should replace (not chain) the 
     the default keyboard interrupt vector with
     the function <i>MyKeyInt</i>. 
     It should preserve a pointer
     to the original keyboard vector for use by 
    <i>DeInstallKey</i>. 
  </ul>
  <p>

<li><font size=+2><b>MyKeyInt</b></font><p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> Read scan codes from the keyboard
  <li><b>Description:</b><br>
    This function replaces the default keyboard vector
    and is used for the duration of the program.  The routine
    should respond to the escape key and to the left, right, and down
    arrow buttons.  
      When the following keys are pressed, the following actions should occur:
    <ul>
      <li>ESC: Set <tt>ExitFlag=1</tt>.  
      <li>Left Arrow: Set <tt>TR=2</tt> <i>(Need right thrust to go left)</i>
      <li>Right Arrow: Set <tt>TL=2</tt> <i>(Need left thrust to go right)</i>
      <li>Down Arrow: Set <tt>T=5</tt> 
    </ul>
  <li><b>Notes</b>:<br>
    Remember that this is an interrupt service rotuine.  Be sure
    to save all registers  and exit with IRET. 
    The keyboard interface is documented in the lab manual (pagees 80-81),
    in the textbook, and on-line in the PC-GPE as 
    <a href="/~ece291/class-resources/gpe/keyboard.txt.html">
     keyboard.txt.html</a> 
  </ul>
<p>

<li><font size=+2><b>DeInstallKey</b></font><p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose</b>: Restore original keyboard vector 
  <li><b>Description:</b> <br>
    This routine should be called just before you exit your program.
    It should restore the default vector for IRQ1.
  </ul>
   <p>


<li><font size=+2><b>DrawScreen</b></font><p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b> Draw the static portion of the graphic screen 
  <li><b>Description:</b><br>
     This routine should draw all the static text, boxes, and graphics on the
     screen that do not change as the lunar lander program runs.
  <li><b>Notes</b>:<br>
     <ul>
     <li>You may find many parts of your MP3 code useful for this routine.
     <li>You will want to create modular components to avoid coding
         repetitive operations.
     <li>The landing pad appears in the middle of the screen at X=0
     <li>You are encouraged and welcome to exercise artistic freedom
       in the implementation of your screen.  At minimum, however,
       you must support the features of the library function.
    </ul>
  </ul>
<p>
<li><font size=+2><b>ReDrawScreen</b></font><p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b>Redraw dynamic portions of graphics screen 
  <li><b>Description:</b><br>
      This routine redraws the portions of the screen that change
      as the lunar lander moves.   
  <li><b>Notes</b>:<br>
      <ul>
     <li>The values displayed are contained within the variables:
      <tt>x, v_x, a_x, y, v_y, a_y, init_fuel, and fuel</tt>.
      <li>Recall that numbers should be displayed in units of
          m and m/s (not m/324 and m/s/18).
      <li>Display thrust if <tt>T, TR, and/or TL</tt> are non-zero.
      <li>For the windowed display, horizontal columns represent 2 m and
          vertical rows represent 4 m.
      </ul>
   </ul>
<p>
<li><font size=+2><b>FinalScreen</b></font><p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b>Prints the messages shown at the end of the program.
  <li><b>Description:</b><br>
    To land successfully, the lander must:
      <ul>
      <li>Hit the pad within 4 m
      <li>Avoid straying off the screen
      <li>Have a slow vertical velocity.  Specifically:

           <ul>
          <li>0 - 3 m/s: Perfect Landing
          <li>3 - 6 m/s: Slight Damage
          <li>6 - 9 m/s: Severe Damage 
          <li>9+ m/s: Crash!       
           </ul> 
      </ul>
    After accessing the status of the landing, the program should
    display the flight time and amount of fuel used.
  <li><b>Notes</b>:<br>
      <ul>
     <li>Print flight time in seconds, not s/18.
     <li>Again, artistic freedom is encouraged as long as your
         program has at least the same features.  Sounds effects
         and/or an animation could easily earn that ever-so-sought-after
         <i>Gold star of programming excellence</i>!
     </ul>
  </ul>

<xmp>

</xmp>
<li><font size=+2><b>Main</b></font><p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Purpose:</b>Main body of the program 
  <li><b>Description:</b><br>
     Once you understand the purpose of the routines above,
     Replace <i>MainLIB</i> with code that
      <ul>
      <li>Draws the original screen
      <li>Installs the timer and keyboard interrupts
      <li>Redraws the screen while <i>ExitFlag=0</i>
      <li>Prints the Final screen
      <li>Deinstalls the timer and keyboard interrupts
      </ul>
   </ul>

</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Points</h2>
You earn points by replacing each subroutine with your own code.
Your score will be proportional to the percentage of the code that
your write yourself.  The breakdown in points is given below.  Your
routine MUST perform all functions of the subroutine to receive credit.
If the same code is submitted by multiple authors, each author will
receive <i>1/n</i> points, where  <i>n</i> is equal to the number of
MPs with the same algorithms.  
<p>
You are urged to test each routine as you write it.  It is nearly
impossible to debug a program if there are errors in the routines 
that it calls.  Note that library routines always call other library
routines.  You need to call your routines directly to verify their
functionality.
<p>
<ul>
<li>InstTime: 2 pts
<li>MyTimeInt: 10 pts
<li>DeInstallTime: 1 pts
<li>InstKey: 2 pts
<li>MyKeyInt: 10 pts
<li>DeInstallKey: 1 pts
<li>DrawScreen: 8 pts.
<li>ReDrawScreen: 7 pts.
<li>FinalScreen: 4 pts.
<li>Main: 5 pts.
<li><i>Bonus</i>: [extra 5 pts]  <Br>
   Add an AutoSolve routine to guide the lander to 
   the pad using minimal fuel.  The routine
   should work regardless where the lander is initially located.
   This code can read any variable but should only write to
   <tt>T, TL, TR</tt>.
  
</ul>
<hr>
