<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>
One of the first programs I loved to play with when I was first learning
computers was the paint program that came with my Apple IIe.  It was the
ultimate outlet for young creative genius, as my parents would have led
me to believe.  But all happy stories come to an end: I grew up and I
realized that using such a program is not all there is to happiness.
Instead, creating a program that lets others create is the obvious path
to self-fulfillment.
</P> <P>
Enter ECE291.  It will be your job to realize this childhood dream I
just made up.  By writing a basic paint program, you will learn many
things.  One is how to manage video mode 13h, the first video mode one
should be introduced to.  Another is handling the mouse and keyboard
together.  Thirdly, double buffering as more than a flicker reduction
device.  The fourth is the framework that modern computing systems
follow in a much more intricate form: the asynchronous Event Queue with
the synchronous Event Loop.
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC=mp4.gif ALIGN=CENTER width="652" height="459"></CENTER>
<H2>Event Loops</H2>
<P>
Windows follows the notion of an Event Loop: a user or the network can
provide asynchronous interrupt events, be it data coming in from the
web, typing on the keyboard, or motion of the mouse.  As ISRs must be
kept short, the program cannot handle everything it must do in response
to the interrupts within the ISR.  Instead, it adds a record of the
event to a queue.  The program runs as one massive state-machine loop,
in which it reads in an event from the queue, processes it, and loops
again.
</P><P>
The Paint Application will let you keep this Event Queue simple - only
Mouse data must be considered.  All keyboard input will be handled
synchronously (part of the main loop of the program, not an ISR).  The
mouse must be handled as an ISR.
</P>
<H2>Handling the Mouse</H2>
<P>
Writing a full ISR for a mouse would probably be a complete pain to
debug.  Luckily for us, the provided ISR is very well designed: it
provides a method to implement a Callback function.  The ISR will handle
reading the mouse and will only call your callback on the occasions you
ask it to.  Check the information in your lab book, and in the books in
the lab (ask a TA), or on the Web.  For this application, you will only
need to monitor the left button and pointer motion.  Place the event in
the Event Queue - our minimal event loop.
</P>
<H2>The Event Queue</H2>
The event queue is used to ensure no mouse movements get lost while you
are handling the previous ones.  You will need to understand this to
construct your mouse handler so it can talk to Main. To implement the
queue we need a structure which contains all information for each event,
and we need to keep track of the locations currently filled by the
queue.  For this queue, we will use a circular array representation;
just remember these rules:
<UL>
 <LI><TT>Queue</TT> is the queue (<TT>offset Queue</TT> refers to the
 front of the queue)
 <LI><TT>QueueFirst</TT> holds the offset of the first entry in the
 queue.
 <LI><TT>QueueNumEvents</TT> holds the number of Events in the queue.
 <LI>Use <TT>QUEUE_ELEMENTS</TT> (number of events that fit into the
 queue) and <TT>QUEUE_SIZE</TT> (total number of bytes allocated for the
 queue) to calculate the positions of the elements, and to not write
 outside of the queue.
 <LI>If <TT>QueueNumEvents</TT> is equal to <TT>QUEUE_ELEMENTS</TT>,
 then no elements may be added to the queue.
 <LI>If <TT>QueueNumEvents</TT> is zero, it implies the Queue is empty.
</UL>
</P><P>
The Event structure is as follows:<BR>
<PRE>Event  STRUC
  X       dw    ?       ; X coordinate in screen pixels from left
  Y       dw    ?       ; Y coordinate in screen pixels from top
  Buttons db    ?       ; Button status (in mouse handler format)
Event ENDS</PRE><BR>
This allows us to pass information around carefully, and efficiently.
When you add an event to the queue, increase the <TT>QueueNumEvents</TT>
counter appropriately.  Don't forget to wrap around the tail end of the
queue when placing the event in memory.  Follow the rule that if
increasing it causes you to run into the front of the
<TT>QueueFirst</TT> you should not add it.  Instead, you would normally
set some error flag, but we will not bother to handle this.
</P><P>
Another time you should not add anything to your queue is when it is a
redundant event.  Specifically, if there is anything in your queue, and
the current event has the same buttons pressed as the last event, do
<b>not</b> add the new event to your queue.
</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="queue.gif" WIDTH=382 HEIGHT=203 ALIGN="center"></CENTER>
<P>
Use <TT>SIZEOF EVENT</TT> to refer to the number of bytes in an event,
and <TT>(EVENT PTR [BX]).X</TT> to refer to the X data for an event at
the offset stored in bx (si and di work as well), etc.
</P>
<H2>The Main Loop</H2>
<P>
The Main Loop is what brings the program together.  It will read in the
information gathered by your mouse handler and call the appropriate
functionality of your program.  If you're drawing a rectangle, and you
have moved the mouse, it will refresh the screen to show the new
rectangle, only committing it to the buffer once the mouse button is
pressed.  
</P><P>
This code is provided free of charge.  You can count on main working as
long as your functions work correctly and preserve all changed
registers.  If you do not preserve registers, there are no such
guarantees.
</P><P>
All events occur when you click the mouse button.  You click once to
select the line tool, a second time to select the starting position of
the line, and a third time to select the end position of the line.  Text
is stored for good when you press enter.
</P>
<H2>The Double Buffer</H2>
<P>
Double Buffering is a method of doing all video operations on a
duplicate block in memory and then blasting them all at once to the real
video memory.  This reduces flicker and actually speeds things up (due
to the lower number of separate writes to the more slowly accessed video
system).  We are going to primarily use it to speed things up, but also
use it to give us one level of preview.
</P><P>
We get this level of preview by making our functions able to write to
either the <B>screen</B> or the <B>ScreenBuffer</B>.  When we have
selected one point in a line, for example, as we move the mouse we can
draw the would-be line to the current mouse position as a preview on the
<B>screen</B>.  When we then click to select the second point, we commit
the change by writing the results to the <B>ScreenBuffer</B>.
</P><P>
The buffer will be called <B>ScreenBuffer</B>.  <B>ScreenBuffer</B>
holds 320x200=64,000 bytes of data, and therefore is kept in its own
segment <B>SBSeg</B>.  This exact copy of what will go onto the screen
is in the same form as the memory mapped video memory you will be
accessing, so you can merely copy the data from one to the other.  To
access this other segment you will need to use the keyword
<B><TT>SEG</TT></B>.  <B><TT>SEG</TT></B> works much like
<B><TT>Offset</TT></B> does in that it assembles to a constant value -
that of the segment the variable is in.  <TT>(Seg ScreenBuffer):[offset
ScreenBuffer]</TT> effectively computes to the linear address of your
ScreenBuffer (but is not a useful thing to assemble).  For example,
consider this code: 

</P><P>
<TABLE border=1 cellPadding=0>
  <TR>
    <TD><TT>MySeg SEGMENT PUBLIC 'DATA1'<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Var1 
      DB<BR>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Var2 DW<BR>
      MySeg ENDS<BR>
      .<BR>
      .<BR>
      .<BR>
      MOV AX, SEG  Var1<BR>
      MOV ES, AX <BR>
      MOV ES:Var1, 10</TT></TD></TR></TABLE>

</P><P>
After the last three lines are executed, ES will contain the segment that 
<TT>Var1</TT> is contained within, i.e., <TT>MySeg</TT>, and 10 will be
written to the actual variable Var1 (in the proper segment). 
</P><P>
Now, the important part.  For this paint program we want to use a
technique called rubberbanding to keep the user informed about what he
is drawing.  For instance, you click the mouse on one point, and as you
move the mouse before you release it, you want the currently chosen line
to show on the screen.  Meanwhile, since it hasn't been chosen yet, you
want to not save it to your actual picture data.  Instead, write it
directly to <TT>VidSeg</TT> without writing to the buffer.
</P><P>
We will handle this by passing a parameter to each drawing function
which identifies the segment to which the drawing should be done.  This
segment will either be that of your buffer or that of the mapped video
memory.  By writing the function modularly, only main needs to handle
this information.
</P>
<H2>Drawing Pixels</H2>
<P>
To draw a pixel to the screen, you must figure out where in memory it
resides.  Thankfully, those who created the memory mapping system didn't
have a mean streak.  For a given point X<SUB>1</SUB>,Y<SUB>1</SUB>,
merely multiply Y<SUB>1</SUB> by the row width, then add X<SUB>1</SUB>.
This is your offset to the chosen segment.  This is very much like text
mode, but there is one vital difference:  in text mode, there were two
bytes per character, whereas in Mode 13h graphics there is one byte per
pixel in a 320x200 pixel screen.
</P><P>
Unfortunately, you must consider one other issue.  Your program's user
must not be able to draw lines all over the screen -- they must be
restricted to the drawing area.  For convienence, some constants have
been EQU declared: <TT>MINX</TT>, <TT>MINY</TT>, <TT>MAXX</TT>, and
<TT>MAXY</TT>.  These paired coordinates are all valid coordinates, but
they are the smallest and largest (respectively) that you may draw to.
Don't forget you can do math with these like (MINX-1) that you can't do
with variables.  This is legal because it is assembled to a single
immediate number.  Note: this may be especially crucial in FloodFill.  
</P>
<H2>Drawing Lines</H2>
<P>
There are many methods for drawing lines.  For an example of one called
Bresenham's Line Algorithm, see <a
href="/ece291/lecture/l19.html">Lecture 19</A>.  The following
paragraphs in this writeup describe another.
</P><P>
In order to compute the (x,y) coordinates for each point, P, along a
line, we must choose an indepedent variable. If we choose y as the
independent variable, then our code will need to compute x as a function
of y for all points between the endpoints of the line. For the line
connecting P<SUB>1</SUB> and P<SUB>2</SUB>, we can compute each (x,y)
point as x = x<SUB>1</SUB> +
(y-y<SUB>1</SUB>)*(x<SUB>2</SUB>-x<SUB>1</SUB>)/(y<SUB>2</SUB>-y<SUB>1</SUB>)
for each value of y between y<SUB>1</SUB> and y<SUB>2</SUB>. The
following figure illustrates how this is done:

<H2>General Notes</H2>
<UL>
 <LI>Look at the Grading Sheet to know what we are looking for in your
 finished MP.
 <LI>Print only the Grade Sheet, 4-UP, Double-Sided, under retribution
 from Your Friendly TAs.
 <LI>Test out your program versus the Grade Sheet to make sure your
 program works perfectly <B>before</b> asking to handin.
</UL>
<H2>Procedures</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>This assignment has several procedures. As usual, you will receive credit 
  by replacing each of the procedures listed below with your own code. 
  <LI>Experiment with the working code to gain a full understanding of how the 
  program works. The library version of LIBMP4 contains fully functional 
  versions of the routines. Much of their functionality can be seen by running 
  the program and testing each of the buttons.
  <LI>All subroutines should be <I>modular</I>. For this MP, we will be using 
  C-style procedures. To simplify coding, MASM provides the <TT>INVOKE</TT> and 
  the <TT>PROTO</TT> directives. The <TT>PROTO</TT> directive allows you to 
  define a C-style function, and the <TT>INVOKE</TT> directive allows you to 
  call a C-style function. For example, the following code would define a 
  function MyFunc with word-size parameters Input1 and Input2: 
  <LI>Debugging may be attempted with CodeView, but be forewarned that
  it is difficult.  CodeView needs to be told that the graphics mode is
  switched, and that the mouse is being used.  Use the command line
  <TT>CV /50 /S /M MP4</TT> for this MP, and be warned that the mouse
  won't work from within CodeView.  Alternately, write some test invokes
  into Main, and you can codeview them with just <TT>CV /50 /S MP4</TT>.
