<P><FONT size=+2><U>Development Environment</U></FONT></P>
<P>The development environment used for this MP is different from all of your other MP's.  For this
MP, you will be using the DJGPP compiler system and the NASM assembler.</P>
<P>DJGPP is a complete 32-bit C/C++ development system for Intel 80386 (and higher) PCs
running DOS (or Win95/98/NT). It includes ports of many GNU development utilities (gcc, g++,
gdb, etc). The development tools require a 80386 or newer computer to run, as do the programs
they produce. In most cases, the programs it produces can be sold commercially without license
or royalties.</P>
<P>NASM is the Netwide Assembler, a free portable assembler for the Intel 80x86 microprocessor
series, which uses the traditional Intel instruction mnemonics and syntax.  It has extensive macro
capabilities and is generally more straightforward in usage (fewer directives and assumptions)
than MASM.&nbsp; There is an <i>excellent</i> helpfile about NASM in <a href="file:///C:/djgpp/contrib/nasm/doc/nasmdoc.hlp">V:\djgpp\contrib\nasm\doc\nasmdoc.hlp</a>&nbsp;
(This is a helpfile for a slightly older version of NASM, so some of the macro
stuff might be different, and we'll put it on the desktop of the lab machines.)</P>
<P>The programs produced by DJGPP run 32-bit protected mode.  The transition from real-mode to
protected-mode is provided by the DJGPP real-mode stub, which calls DPMI (the DOS Protected
Mode Interface).  DPMI is also used by DJGPP programs to allocate memory, set interrupt
vectors, and perform protected-mode to real-mode (and vice-versa) interrupt call translations. 
DPMI functionality is provided by all versions of Windows and under plain DOS by a free utility
(included with DJGPP) called CWSDPMI.</P>
<P>Normally setting up DJGPP and NASM requires the downloading of numerous (20+) ZIP files
and some minor configuration.  However, a fully installed and configured version of DJGPP is
available on the lab machines.  This installation also includes NASM 0.98, the latest version of
NASM.  To set the environment variables required by DJGPP, run <a href="file:///C:/djgpp/djgpp.bat">V:\djgpp\djgpp.bat</a>&nbsp;
(This should be done automatically in autoexec.bat on the lab machines.)</P>
<P>If you want to develop at home, everything you need is in the <a href="file:///C:/djgpp/djgpp.bat">V:\djgpp\</a>
directory.&nbsp; Just copy this folder onto your own machine and run <a href="file:///C:/djgpp/djgpp.bat">djgpp.bat</a>
to set the path.</P>

<p><b>Stuff to Do:</b></p>
<p>Make an tutorial folder.&nbsp; Make an basic.asm file.&nbsp; Put this into the
basic.asm file:&nbsp; (I know we could have made an tutorial.zip with everything in it,
but then you wouldn't learn anything.)</p>
<table border="1" width="100%" height="100">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" height="94"><pre>BITS 32          ; Tell NASM we're using 32-bit protected mode.

GLOBAL _main     ; Tells the linker about the label called _main

  </tr>
</table>

<P>Type &quot;<b><samp>nasm -f coff basic.asm&nbsp; -l basic.lst</samp></b>&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A quick run of &quot;<b><samp>nasm -hf</samp></b>&quot; will inform you that this assembles your .asm
file and creates &quot;<b><samp>basic.o</samp></b>&quot; in the form of a coff object file.&nbsp;
(This is the format that the DJGPP linker can read.)&nbsp; The object file contains
your assembled code, your data, and information about your variable and label
names so that the linker can link your object file with other object files. It
also creates a list file called &quot;<b><samp>basic.lst</samp></b>&quot; which the debugger uses
to match up lines of code with assembled opcodes.&nbsp; This is just a text
file, so you can look at it in a text editor.&nbsp; Look at it.&nbsp; You see
your code with line numbers, addresses, and data tacked on to your code.</P>

<P>Type &quot;<b><samp>objdump --disassemble-all basic.o</samp></b>&quot; to disassemble the
object file that NASM created.&nbsp; Look at stuff.&nbsp; This is the
information that's in an object file.<b><br>
</b><br>
Type &quot;<b><samp>ld -o basic --cref -Map basic.map v:/djgpp/lib/crt0.o basic.o -Lv:/djgpp/lib
-Lv:/djgpp/lib/gcc-lib/djgpp/2.81 -lgcc -lc</samp></b>&quot; which runs the linker to
take our basic.o file and link it with a bunch of standard C and C++
libraries.&nbsp; (You don't actually use any of these libraries, but you still
need to do this because it's the ctr0.o where your _main is actually
called.)&nbsp; A linker takes a bunch of assembled object files and sticks them
all in the same object file.&nbsp; You can call routines or access variables in
my .asm files as long as I declare them public.&nbsp; When I declare something
public, NASM will put a put it's name and address into the object file it
creates.&nbsp; Your .asm file, with it's reference to my routine or variable,
will be assembled into an object file with an unresolved link.&nbsp; The linker
takes these two object files, matches up the names, and puts the address of my
routine into your code instead of just a name.&nbsp; You can run &quot;<b><samp>ld --h
| more</samp></b>&quot; to see what this command-line means.&nbsp; (That's what I had
to do.)</P>

<ul>
  <li>&quot;<b><samp>-o simple</samp></b>&quot; sets the linker's output file to a file
    called &quot;simple&quot; (with no extension.)</li>
  <li>&quot;<b><samp>--cref</samp></b>&quot; creates an output cross reference table.&nbsp;
    This adds cross references (what's calling what) into the map file.</li>
  <li>&quot;<b><samp>-Map tutorial.map</samp></b>&quot; tells it to create a map file called
    &quot;tutorial.map&quot;&nbsp; This is used by the debugger to get the offsets
    of the modules and the functions.&nbsp; It doesn't give the offset of every
    line, though.&nbsp; For this, you need the list file from NASM.&nbsp; Open
    up the map file to see what kind of information it has.</li>
  <li>&quot;<b><samp>v:/djgpp/lib/crt0.o basic.o</samp></b>&quot; tells the linker the
    object files to link together and in what order.&nbsp; The first thing you
    list will be the first thing that will go into the output file, and the
    place where program execution starts. The first thing you want in your
    output file is crt0.o&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the standard C library that sets
    up some stuff (environment variables, command line, etc) and finally call's
    your C-style _main.&nbsp; The second object we link in is, of course, the
    object you created with your _main.</li>
  <li>&quot;<b><samp>-Lv:/djgpp/lib -Lv:/djgpp/lib/gcc-lib/djgpp/2.81</samp></b>&quot; Sets
    up two paths for the libraries.</li>
  <li>&quot;<b><samp>-lgcc -lc</samp></b>&quot; tells the linker to link in GCC's &quot;libgcc.a&quot;
    and &quot;libc.a&quot; libraries. (The &quot;-l&quot; takes the name you
    give it, sticks on a &quot;lib&quot; in front, a &quot;.a&quot; in back, and
    looks in the library paths you gave it with &quot;-L&quot; for this file.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Type &quot;<b><samp>objdump --disassemble-all simple > out.txt</samp></b>&quot; and look
at out.txt (which is now huge) to see the dump of the object file it created
with all the libraries.&nbsp; Find &lt;start&gt; and &lt;exit&gt;.&nbsp;
&lt;start&gt; is where protected mode execution actually starts.&nbsp; It
eventually calls your &lt;_main&gt;&nbsp; When &lt;_main&gt; returns, you end up
in the &lt;exit&gt; code which calls the &lt;_exit&gt; code which calls the &lt;__exit&gt;
code.&nbsp; This is how C works.&nbsp; Be afraid.&nbsp; Be very afraid.</p>
<p>Type &quot;<b><samp>stubify simple</samp></b>&quot;&nbsp; which takes the raw coff format
executable that ld spits out.&nbsp; It creates a real-mode DOS executable that:
makes the switch from real-mode to protected mode, requests memory for your
program, loads your program, and begins execution at the first instruction
(which is at the beginning of crt.o)</p>
<p>Type &quot;<b><samp>objdump --disassemble-all basic.exe > out.txt</samp></b>&quot; and
look at out.txt to see the dump of the with the stub added.&nbsp; &quot;Hey, it
looks the same!&quot;&nbsp; I think this is because all of the GNU development
tools strip off the .exe headers and the stubs.</p>
<p>Type &quot;<b><samp>simple</samp></b>&quot; to <i>finally</i> run your program.&nbsp;
Nothing happened?&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; Awe at the fact that you only actually
had one line of your own assembly, yet twenty million things had to go on to get
you into and out of protected mode, to load your code, to interact with the
operating system, to toggle the bits in the microprocessor, to manipulate the
quantum state of billions and billions of electrons, etc, etc...</p>
<p>Type &quot;<b><samp>cv32 simple</samp></b>&quot; to actually see what's going on.&nbsp;
This is the best 32-bit debugger we have so far.&nbsp; Hit <b>F8</b> a few times
to step through.&nbsp; (Go slow, or you'll miss your one line!) <b>Alt-H</b>
brings up a help screen.&nbsp; <b>Alt-X</b> exits.&nbsp; More on this after we
have a better program to debug.</p>

<P><FONT size=+2><U>What Actually Happened When You Ran Your Program</U></FONT></P>
<P>The startup of a DJGPP protected-mode program is far more complex than a real-mode MASM
program.  First, DOS reads in the real-mode stub and executes it.  This real-mode stub checks to
see if DPMI is available, and then uses it to switch to
protected mode.  After switching to protected mode, it then asks the operating
system to allocate memory for the program's
code and data segments, loads the protected mode image from disk, and then directs processor
execution into the DJGPP crt0 library startup code.  Crt0 does some dirty work such as reading
the command line and initializing the standard library, and then runs your _main.</P>
