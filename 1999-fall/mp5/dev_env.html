<P>The development environment used for this MP is different from all of your other MP's.  For this
MP, you will be using the DJGPP compiler system and the NASM assembler.&nbsp;
The entire environment is <b><samp>V:\djgpp\</samp></b>.&nbsp;
&quot;Our players at home&quot; can download and unzip <a href="djgpp.zip">djgpp.zip</a></P>

    <td><b><i>DJGPP</i></b> is a complete 32-bit C/C++ development system for Intel 80386 (and higher) PCs
running DOS (or Win95/98/NT). It includes ports of many standard GNU development utilities
      (gcc, g++, gdb, etc). The development tools require a 80386 or newer computer to run, as do the programs
they produce. In most cases, the programs it produces can be sold commercially without license
or royalties.</td>

    <td><b><i>NASM</i></b> is the Netwide Assembler, a free, portable assembler for the Intel 80x86 microprocessor
series, which uses the traditional Intel instruction mnemonics and syntax.&nbsp;
      (This is more readable than DJGPP's own assembler which uses a bizzare
      looking, backwards AT&amp;T syntax.)&nbsp;  It has extensive macro
capabilities and is generally more straightforward in usage (fewer directives and assumptions)
than MASM.&nbsp; There is an <i>excellent</i> helpfile about NASM in <a href="nasmdoc.hlp">nasmdoc.hlp</a>&nbsp;
(This is a helpfile for a slightly older version of NASM, so some of the macro
stuff might be different.)&nbsp; We'll put it in the <b><samp> V:\</samp></b> drive or on the desktop of the lab

protected-mode is provided by the DJGPP real-mode stub, which calls DPMI.  DPMI is also used by DJGPP programs to allocate memory, set interrupt
vectors, and perform protected-mode to real-mode (and vice-versa) interrupt call translations.</td>

<P>Normally setting up DJGPP and NASM requires the downloading of numerous (20+) ZIP files
and some minor configuration.  However, a fully installed and configured version of DJGPP is
available on the lab machines.  This installation also includes NASM 0.98, the latest version of
NASM. All you need to do to get the environment variables set properly is:</P>
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><samp><b>SET PATH=V:\djgpp\bin</b><br>
      SET TMP=C:\WINDOWS\TEMP<br>
      SET TEMP=C:\WINDOWS\TEMP<br>
      <b>SET DJGPP=V:\djgpp\djgpp.env</b><br>
      doskey</samp></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<P>This should be done automatically in <samp> autoexec.bat</samp> on the lab
machines.&nbsp; If it's not (take a look), copy over <samp><b>autoexec.bat</b></samp>
file from the <samp><b>V:\</b></samp>
 drive and reboot.&nbsp; This properly sets path and environment variables for
both MASM and NASM.</P>
<P>If you want to develop at home, everything you need is in <a href="djgpp.zip">djgpp.zip</a>.&nbsp; Just
unzip this onto your own machine, set the
environment variables above, and you're good to go.</P>

<P>To into the directory and type &quot;<b><samp>nasm -f coff basic.asm&nbsp; -l basic.lst</samp></b>&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A quick run of &quot;<b><samp>nasm -hf</samp></b>&quot; will inform you that this assembles your
&quot;<b><samp>basic.asm</samp></b>&quot; file and creates &quot;<b><samp>basic.o</samp></b>&quot; in the form of a coff object file.&nbsp;
(This is the format that the DJGPP linker can read.)&nbsp; The object file contains
your assembled code, your data, and information about your variable and label
names so that the linker can link your object file with other object files. It
also creates a list file called &quot;<b><samp>basic.lst</samp></b>&quot; which the debugger uses
to match up lines of code in your <b><samp>.asm</samp></b> file with assembled opcodes.&nbsp;
<b><samp>basic.lst</samp></b> is just a text
file, so you can look at it in a text editor.&nbsp; Look at it.&nbsp; You see
your code with line numbers, addresses, and data tacked on to your code.&nbsp; <a href="questions.html#Question2">Question
2:</a>&nbsp; What is the opcode for ret?&nbsp; How many bytes were the two
opcodes?</P>

<P>Type &quot;<b><samp>objdump --disassemble-all basic.o</samp></b>&quot; to disassemble the
object file that NASM created and print it's contents to the screen.&nbsp; (This
step doesn't actually <i>do</i> anything, it's just to see how NASM works.)&nbsp; Look at stuff.&nbsp; This is the
information that's in an object file.&nbsp; <a href="questions.html#Question3">Question 3:</a>&nbsp;
How much of the mov opcode was actually opcode and how much data?&nbsp;
Hint:&nbsp; Find the hex value of your data in the opcode.<b><br>
</b><br>
Type &quot;<b><samp>ld -o basic --cref -Map basic.map v:/djgpp/lib/crt0.o basic.o -Lv:/djgpp/lib
-Lv:/djgpp/lib/gcc-lib/djgpp/2.81 -lgcc -lc</samp></b>&quot; which runs the linker to
take our <b><samp> basic.o</samp></b> file and link it with a bunch of standard C and C++
libraries.&nbsp; We don't actually use any of the standard libraries, but you still
need to do this because it's the <b><samp>crt0.o</samp></b> where execution
actually starts and where your <b><samp> _main</samp></b> is called.</P>

<P>A linker takes a bunch of assembled object files and sticks them
all into one big object file.&nbsp; You can call routines or access variables in
<i>
my</i> <b><samp> .asm</samp></b> files as long as I declare them public.&nbsp; When I declare something
public, NASM will put a put it's name and address into the object file it
creates.&nbsp; <i>Your</i> <b><samp> .asm</samp></b> file, with it's reference to my routine or variable,
will be assembled into an object file with an unresolved link.&nbsp; The linker
takes these two object files, matches up the names, and puts the address of my
routine into your code instead of just an unresolved name.&nbsp; You can run &quot;<b><samp>ld --h
| more</samp></b>&quot; to see what this command-line means.&nbsp; (That's what I had
to do.)</P>

<ul>
  <li>&quot;<b><samp>-o basic</samp></b>&quot; sets the linker's output file to a file
    called &quot;basic&quot; (with no extension.)</li>
  <li>&quot;<b><samp>--cref</samp></b>&quot; creates an output cross reference table.&nbsp;
    This adds cross references (what's calling what) into the map file.</li>
  <li>&quot;<b><samp>-Map basic.map</samp></b>&quot; tells it to create a map file called
    &quot;basic.map&quot;&nbsp; This is used by the debugger to get the offsets
    of the modules and the functions.&nbsp; It doesn't give the offset of every
    line, though.&nbsp; For this, you need the list file from NASM.&nbsp; Open
    up the map file to see what kind of information it has.</li>
  <li>&quot;<b><samp>v:/djgpp/lib/crt0.o basic.o</samp></b>&quot; tells the linker the
    object files to link together, and in what order.&nbsp; The first thing you
    list will be the first thing that will go into the output file, and the
    place where program execution starts. The first thing you want in your
    output file is <b><samp> crt0.o</samp></b>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the standard C library that sets
    up some stuff (environment variables, command line, etc) and finally call's
    your C-style <b><samp>_main</samp></b>.&nbsp; The second object we link in is, of course, the
    object you created which contains your <b><samp>_main</samp></b>.</li>
  <li>&quot;<b><samp>-Lv:/djgpp/lib -Lv:/djgpp/lib/gcc-lib/djgpp/2.81</samp></b>&quot; Sets
    up two paths for the libraries.</li>
  <li>&quot;<b><samp>-lgcc -lc</samp></b>&quot; tells the linker to link in GCC's &quot;libgcc.a&quot;
    and &quot;libc.a&quot; libraries. (The &quot;-l&quot; takes the name you
    give it, sticks on a &quot;lib&quot; in front, a &quot;.a&quot; in back, and
    looks in the library paths you gave it with &quot;-L&quot; for this file.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Type &quot;<b><samp>objdump --disassemble-all basic > out.txt</samp></b>&quot; and look
at out.txt (which is now huge) to see the dump of the object file it created
with all the libraries.&nbsp; Find &lt;_qsort>.&nbsp; Find &lt;start&gt; and &lt;exit&gt;.&nbsp;
&lt;start&gt; is where protected mode execution actually starts.&nbsp; It
eventually calls your &lt;_main&gt;&nbsp; When &lt;_main&gt; returns, you end up
in the &lt;exit&gt; code which calls the &lt;_exit&gt; code which calls the &lt;__exit&gt;
code.&nbsp; This is how C works.&nbsp; Be afraid.&nbsp; Be very afraid.</p>
<p>Type &quot;<b><samp>stubify basic</samp></b>&quot;&nbsp; which takes the raw coff format
executable that ld spat out.&nbsp; It creates a real-mode DOS executable that:
makes the switch from real-mode to protected mode, requests memory for your
program, loads your program, and begins execution at the first instruction
(which is at the beginning of crt.o)</p>
<p>Type &quot;<b><samp>objdump --disassemble-all basic.exe > out.txt</samp></b>&quot; and
look at out.txt to see the dump of the with the stub added.&nbsp; &quot;Hey, it
looks the same!&quot;&nbsp; I think this is because all of the GNU development
tools strip off the .exe headers and the stubs, and so you can never see what
those look like.&nbsp; Again, this line doesn't <i>do</i> anything required to
continue, but I want to you see the output.</p>
<p>Type &quot;<b><samp>basic</samp></b>&quot; to <i>finally</i> run your program.&nbsp;
Nothing happened?&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; Awe at the fact that you only actually
had one line of your own assembly, yet twenty million things had to go on to get
you into and out of protected mode, to load your code, to interact with the
operating system, to toggle the bits in the microprocessor, to manipulate the
quantum state of billions and billions of electrons, etc, etc...</p>
<p>Type &quot;<b><samp>cv32 basic</samp></b>&quot; to actually see what's going on.&nbsp;
This is the best 32-bit debugger we have so far.&nbsp; Hit <b>F8</b> a few times
to step through.&nbsp; (Go slow, or you'll miss your one line!) <b>Alt-H</b>
brings up a help screen.&nbsp; <b>Alt-X</b> exits.&nbsp; More on this after we
have a better program to debug.</p>

<P><FONT size=+2><a name="What Actually Happened When You Ran Your Program">What Actually Happened When You Ran Your Program</a></FONT></P>
<P>The startup of a DJGPP protected-mode program is far more complex than a real-mode MASM
program.  First, DOS reads in the real-mode stub and executes it.  This real-mode stub checks to
see if DPMI is available, and then uses it to switch to
protected mode.  After switching to protected mode, it then asks the operating
system to allocate memory for the program's
code and data segments, loads the protected mode image from disk, and then directs processor
execution into the DJGPP <b><samp> crt0</samp></b> library startup code. <b><samp>crt0</samp></b> does some dirty work such as reading
the command line and initializing the standard library, and then runs your <b><samp>_main</samp></b>.
