<P><font size="+2"><u><a name="How to Do this MP">High Resolution Graphics with
VESA</a></u></font></P>
<p>320x200x256 was nice.&nbsp; You needed a pallette, so that was kind of
icky.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you ever opened up one of the .bmp files from MP4 in a
windows image editor, you saw how small they really were.&nbsp; You want cool
graphics, these days you use a high resolution, full color mode.&nbsp; That's
what this section is all about.&nbsp; There is an <i>excellent</i> introduction
to this stuff at <a href="http://www.osha.igs.net/~dandelong/nw/index.htm">http://www.osha.igs.net/~dandelong/nw/index.htm</a>
under PC Graphics / SVGA.&nbsp; He's got stuff on Bresenham's Algorithm
too!&nbsp; Spend at least ten minutes looking over this.&nbsp; Of course you <i>won't</i>
look over it unless I ask you a <a href="questions.html">Question 5:</a>&nbsp;
How would you set the Set VBE Video Mode to 1024*768*24bit color so that we
could access the screen using a linear array?&nbsp; Give me numbers!</p>
