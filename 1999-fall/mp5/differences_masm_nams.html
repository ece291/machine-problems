<P><FONT size=+2><U> Differences between MASM and NASM</U></FONT></P>
<P>Notice that NASM directives are much different than MASM ones.  While the NASM help files provide very detailed information
about all of the NASM directives as well as the macro system, here's a short overview of most of
the ones used here:</P>
<TABLE border=2><TR>
<TD><CODE>%include</CODE></TD>
<TD width=25>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD colspan=2>This preprocessor command works just like <CODE>#include</CODE> in C.&nbsp;
  It just inserts the file you tell it into your code.</TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD><CODE>BITS 32</CODE></TD>
<TD width=25>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD colspan=2>This directive tells NASM this is a 32-bit assembly file.</TD>
</TR><TR>
<TD><CODE>SECTION</CODE></TD>
<TD width=25>&nbsp;</TD>
<TD colspan=2>This directive tells NASM what segment everything between it and the next
SECTION directive will go into.  There are three sections most commonly used:</TD>

<P><B>NASM Is Case-Sensitive</B>
<BR>One simple difference is that NASM is case-sensitive. It makes a difference whether you call
your label <CDOE>foo, <CODE>Foo</CODE> or <CODE>FOO</CODE>.

<P><b>Uninitialized (.bss) Section</b>
<BR>Sure MASM could have uninitialized variables with &quot;dw ?&quot; but this
was totally stupid because everyone knew it started out with a value of
zero.&nbsp; Why have an uninitialized section?&nbsp; Let me be a lawyer and
answer that question with another:&nbsp; Where are the initial values for the
initialized variables stored?&nbsp; They must be assembled and linked into the
executable, and so they must take up space.&nbsp; In MASM, if you declare a
bunch of data, it will devote part of the executable to that data.&nbsp; All
those BufferSegs and FontSegs and ScratchSegs and everyting else all were
included in the .exe file.&nbsp; This is pretty stupid because there's no reason
64k of zeros need to be stored in the .exe file.&nbsp; The situation is even
worse in protected mode where you'll want to declare 4MB buffers for
high-resolution images.<P>So back to the uninitialized Section.&nbsp; When the
program gets loaded, the loader reads all the initialized data right from the
file into memory.&nbsp; It also reads <i>one number</i> telling it how much
uninitialized data there was and allocates that much space for it in
memory.&nbsp; Much smarter, eh?&nbsp; If a variable doesn't need an initial
value, put it in the uninitialized section.<P>Why is the code section called
.text and the uninitiated section called .bss?&nbsp; Standard UNIX / C names for
things.

<P><b>Labels are everything.</b>
<BR>This was true in MASM too, but people for some reason believe that the
&quot;proc&quot; stuff was magical.&nbsp; NASM has no build in proc, so
everything is a label.&nbsp; A subroutine can be nothing but a label that you
&quot;call&quot; to instead of &quot;jmp&quot; to.&nbsp; Of course the call will
push the return address on the stack, and the &quot;ret&quot; a the end of your
subroutine will pop it, so you can't just &quot;jmp&quot; to your subroutine or
it will return to some random value that just happened to be on the stack.

<P>Also, you may notice the widespread use of <CODE>.label</CODE>'s.  These are "local" labels that are local to
the last label without a dot before it.&nbsp; This is so you don't have to worry
about having two labels with the same name. You also don't need a colon after the
label name, but it has to appear on a line by itself.&nbsp; Here's a few other differences between NASM and
MASM (taken from the NASM manual section 2.2):

<P><B>NASM Requires Square Brackets For ALL Memory References</B>
<BR>NASM was designed with simplicity of syntax in mind. One of the design goals of NASM is that
it should be possible, as far as is practical, for the user to look at a single line of NASM code and
tell what opcode is generated by it. You can't do this in MASM: if you declare, for example,<br>
<table border="1" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">

<P><samp>foo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; equ 1<br>
bar&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dw 2<br>
<br>
mov ax, foo&nbsp;&nbsp; ; MASM spits out <b>mov ax, 1</b><br>
mov ax, bar&nbsp;&nbsp; ; MASM spits out <b>mov ax, word ds:[12]</b>  if offset
bar happens to be 12.</samp></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<P>The bottom two lines generate completely different opcodes, despite having identical-looking syntaxes.</P>
<P>NASM avoids this undesirable situation by having a much simpler syntax for memory
references. The rule is simply that any access to the <I>contents</I> of a memory location requires
square brackets around the address, and any access to the <I>address</I> of a variable doesn't. So an
instruction of the form <CODE>mov ax, foo</CODE> will <I>always</I> refer to a compile-time constant, whether it's an
<CODE>EQU</CODE> or the address of a variable; and to access the <I>contents</I> of the variable bar, you must code
<CODE>mov ax, [bar]</CODE>.&nbsp; <b>You <i> will</i> forget this when you code!</b></P>
<P>This also means that NASM has no need for MASM's <CODE>OFFSET</CODE> keyword, since the
MASM code <CODE>mov ax, offset bar</CODE> means exactly the same thing as NASM's <CODE>mov ax, bar</CODE>.
(If you're
trying to get large amounts of MASM code to assemble sensibly under NASM, you can always
code <CODE>%idefine offset</CODE> to make the preprocessor treat the <CODE>OFFSET</CODE> keyword as a no-op.) </P>
<table border="1" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">MASM Syntax</td>
    <td width="50%">NASM Syntax</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%"><samp>bob db&nbsp; 12h<br>
      <br>
      mov dx, offset bob&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      </samp>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <samp>; 16-bit, so address is 16-bit<br>
      mov al, bob<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; ; MASM remembers variable types, so<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; ; you don't need &quot;byte ptr&quot;&nbsp;</samp></td>
    <td width="50%"><samp>bob db&nbsp; 12h<br>
      <br>
      mov edx, bob&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; 32-bit address.&nbsp; No offset keyword<br>
      mov al, byte [bob]&nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; Memory accesses require []'s.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; You need the &quot;byte&quot; keyword always.</samp></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<P>NASM, in the interests of simplicity, also does not support the hybrid syntaxes supported
by MASM and its clones, such as <CODE>mov ax, table[bx]</CODE>, where a memory reference is denoted by one
portion outside square brackets and another portion inside. The correct syntax for the above is
&quot;<CODE>mov ax, [table+bx]</CODE>&quot;&nbsp; Likewise, &quot;<CODE>mov ax,
es:[di]</CODE>&quot; is wrong and &quot;<CODE>mov ax, [es:di]</CODE>&quot; is right.</P>

<P><B>NASM Doesn't Store Variable Types</B>
<BR>NASM, by design, chooses not to remember the types of variables you declare. Whereas MASM
will remember, on seeing <CODE>var dw 0</CODE>, that you declared var as a word-size variable, and will then
be able to fill in the ambiguity in the size of the instruction <CODE>mov var, 2</CODE>, NASM will deliberately
remember nothing about the symbol var except where it begins, and so you must <i> explicitly</i> code
<CODE>mov word [var], 2</CODE>.
<P>For this reason, NASM doesn't support the <CODE>LODS</CODE>, <CODE>MOVS</CODE>,
<CODE>STOS</CODE>, <CODE>SCAS</CODE>, <CODE>CMPS</CODE>, <CODE>INS</CODE>, or
<CODE>OUTS</CODE> instructions, but only supports the forms such as
<CODE>LODSB</CODE>, <CODE>MOVSW</CODE>, and <CODE>SCASD</CODE>, which
explicitly specify the size of the components of the strings being manipulated.</P>

<P><B>NASM Doesn't ASSUME</B>
<BR>As part of NASM's drive for simplicity, it also does not support the ASSUME directive.
NASM will not keep track of what values you choose to put in your segment registers, and will
never <I>automatically</I> generate a segment override prefix.

<P><B>Floating-Point Differences</B>
<BR>NASM uses different names to refer to floating point registers from MASM: where MASM
would call them <CODE>ST(0)</CODE>, <CODE>ST(1)</CODE> and so on, NASM chooses to call them
<CODE>st0</CODE>, <CODE>st1</CODE> etc.
<P>NASM does not declare uninitialised storage in the same way as MASM: where a
MASM programmer might use <CODE>stack db 64 dup (?)</CODE>, NASM requires <CODE>stack resb 64</CODE>, intended to be
read as `reserve 64 bytes'. For a limited amount of compatibility, since NASM treats ? as a valid
character in symbol names, you can code <CODE>? equ 0</CODE> and then writing <CODE>dw ?</CODE> will at least do
something vaguely useful. <CODE>DUP</CODE> is still not a supported syntax, however. </P>

<P><b>How this Effects 291</b><br>
NASM syntax is <i>much</i> better than MASM syntax.&nbsp; It we had started you
out with NASM, variables and such would have made much more sense.&nbsp; You
aren't used to NASM, though.&nbsp; You <i>will</i> have problems.&nbsp; You <i>will</i>
try to move the contents of a variable without []'s and it will move the
variable's offset instead.&nbsp; Read this section many times.&nbsp; If
something doesn't seem to work, read this section.&nbsp; Before you call over a
TA, read this section.&nbsp; Remember both syntaxes for your exam coding
questions -- we'll tell you which to use. </P>

<P><b>Stuff to Do:</b> </P>

<P>Type this into a &quot;<samp><b>variable.asm</b></samp>&quot; file:&nbsp; Actually type it in or you won't
&quot;feel&quot; the different syntax.&nbsp; I know this sounds lame, but was
either this or I make you write another Parse! </P>

<P><font size="+2"><u>Setting up a Makefile</u></font></P>
<P>Typing in all those commands every time would be a pain, so smart people
started putting all those commands in a script so you only had to type them in
once and just run the script.&nbsp; Even smarter came up with this concept of
Makefiles.&nbsp; Makefiles have rules that tell how to make different types of
files.&nbsp; You want to make a .o file?&nbsp; Well you need to run NASM on the
.asm file.&nbsp; You want to make a .exe file?&nbsp; Well you have to link a
bunch of .o files together and stubify the sucker.&nbsp; The other big thing
about make files is that they do dependancy checking.&nbsp; You want to make the
bob.o file?&nbsp; That file requires the bob.asm file, so let's check to see if
the bob.asm file is newer than our current bob.o file.&nbsp; If it's not, we
don't have to remake it.&nbsp; This way you only remake the things that have
changed.&nbsp; The Makefiles we will use are standard UNIX GCC Makefiles, which
is something that is just good to know about.&nbsp; When you type &quot;make,&quot; the make program will look in the &quot;Makefile.&quot;&nbsp;
We want the Makefile to do what we did up there, only better.</P>
<P>The Makefile used by DJGPP is in the GNU (Unix) format, which among other things requires
command lines to start with <b>tabs</b>, so if you edit the Makefile, be sure to use a text editor which
preserves tabs.&nbsp; WinEdit does not do this, so you have to use something
like Notepad.&nbsp; (Gasp.)</P>
<P><b>Stuff to Do:</b></P>
<P>In your tutorial folder, make a file called &quot;Makefile&quot; (with no
extension) and type this in it:&nbsp; Remember, those have to be TABS, not spaces!&nbsp; Also, the ld line
is too long to fit on one line in the browser, so it probably wraps, but
has to be all on one line in your Makefile.</P>

<P>Here is how a Makefile works:</P>
<ul>
  <li>When you type &quot;<b><samp>make BOB</samp></b>&quot; it will look in the file for a line
    that begins with &quot;<b><samp>BOB:</samp></b>&quot; and runs the next line.</li>
  <li>For example, when you type &quot;<b><samp>make clean</samp></b>&quot; it will look for the
    <b>
    &quot;<samp>clean:</samp></b>&quot; line and run &quot;<b><samp>rm *.o
    tutorial.exe *.lst variable.map</samp></b>&quot; which just removes your
    temporary files.&nbsp; ( rm happens
    to be built into the make program for those of you who noticed this wouldn't
    normally work under DOS.)</li>
  <li>When you type &quot;<b><samp>make variable.exe</samp></b>,&quot; it will look at the
    &quot;<samp><b>variable.exe</b>:</samp>&quot; line.
    <ul>
      <li>This line has a dependency after the colon, which we put in there to tell
        make that you need to have an <b><samp>variable.o</samp></b> before you can make
        <samp><b>variable.exe</b></samp>.&nbsp; Also, it
        tells make that <b><samp>variable.exe</samp></b>
        doesn't need to be remade if the <b><samp>variable.o</samp></b>
        file doesn't need to be remade.&nbsp; (It checks the dependency's of <b><samp>variable.o</samp></b>)</li>
      <li>If <b><samp>variable.o</samp></b> doesn't exist yet or if
        it's dependencies (<b><samp>variable.asm</samp></b>)
        have changed, make does the equivalent of &quot;<b><samp>make tutorial.o</samp></b>&quot;</li>
      <li>This looks for a &quot;<b><samp>variable.o:</samp></b>&quot; rule.&nbsp; It finds one in the
        &quot;<b><samp>%.o:</samp></b>&quot; rule.</li>
      <li><b><samp>variable.o</samp></b> depends on <b><samp>variable.asm</samp></b>, so if
        <b><samp>variable.asm</samp></b> is newer than <b><samp>variable.o</samp></b> or if
        <b><samp>variable.o</samp></b> doesn't exist, it will run
        NASM.</li>
      <li>On the NASM line there is a &quot;<b><samp>$&lt;</samp></b>&quot;, which
        gets replaced first item after the colon, which is &quot;<b><samp>variable.asm</samp></b>&quot;
        in this case.</li>
      <li> &quot;<b><samp>$*</samp></b>&quot; gets replaced by the first item after the
        colon, but without the extension, so just &quot;<b><samp>variable</samp></b>&quot; in this case.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If you type &quot;<b><samp>make</samp></b>&quot; with no arguments, it looks for the first
    rule and does it.&nbsp; In this case it's the &quot;<b><samp>all:</samp></b>&quot; rule, which
    will depends on <b><samp>variable.exe</samp></b>&nbsp; If
    <b><samp>variable.exe</samp></b> needs updating,
    it will execute the &quot;<b><samp>variable.exe:</samp></b>&quot; rule. etc, etc, etc...</li>
  <li>You can make a huge build tree and all sorts of complicated dependencies
    with Makefiles.&nbsp; These huge build trees are usually made every night
    for large coding projects.&nbsp; If someone does something stupid which
    causes an error in everyone's build, they've &quot;broken the build
    tree&quot; and are often forced to buy beer for everyone.</li>
</ul>
<P>Pull up a DOS window, go into your tutorial directory, and type &quot;<b>make</b>.&quot;&nbsp;
This will run the make program which looks at your Makefile and does all that
complicated stuff I just described.&nbsp; If you still have spaces instead of
tabs, you'll get an error like &quot;<b><samp>Makefile:8: *** missing separator.
Stop</samp></b>&quot;</P>
<P>Type &quot;<b><samp>dir</samp></b>&quot; to see all the stuff that got spit out.</P>

<P>Type &quot;<b><samp>variable</samp></b>&quot; to run your program.&nbsp;
Nothing?&nbsp; Good.</P>
