<P><b>Addresses are 32-bit<br>
</b>Think of the address space as one, big, flat 32-bit space. When you access
memory, you need to access it with 32-bit addresses.&nbsp; [di] is as
meaningless as [dl] was in real mode. </P>

<P><b>You Can Use Any Register to Access Memory<br>
</b>You can access memory like this [segment : any_32-bit_register +
any_other_32-bit_register*(1/2/4/8) + constant]&nbsp; This means that this is
all legal: </P>

<P><b>Segments are <i>Completely</i> Different.&nbsp; They're now Selectors.<br>
</b>If you have a picture in your head of how segments work in real mode,
great.&nbsp; If you know about how to calculate a linear address by multiplying
the segment by 16 and adding the offset, great.&nbsp; You'll need this for the
exam.&nbsp; You won't need this for protected mode.&nbsp; The segment registers in protected
mode are now the selector registers. A <b><i>selector</i></b> is an index into a
descriptor table.&nbsp; In the case of a single application program, it's an
index into the Local Descriptor
Table.&nbsp; The Local Descriptor Table is a table of (you guessed it) <b><i>descriptors</i></b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Descriptors hold information about a sub-region of the 4 Gigabyte
32-bit physical address space.&nbsp; Enough of me trying to throw BS theory on
you like a CS class.&nbsp; Let's look at some stuff. </P>

<ul>
  <li>Open some program in cv32.</li>
  <li>The help (Alt-H) tells me that to look at the local descriptor table, you
    type Alt-L, so I did.</li>
  <li>I looked at my Code Selector and saw that it was Local Descriptor Table
    entry number EFh, so I scrolled down to this offset.</li>
  <li>Sure enough, it said that it was a code selector that was read only.&nbsp;
    It started at some huge linear starting address (0x837e5000) and was pretty
    big (0x0001ffff).</li>
  <li>Then I looked at my Default/Data Slector and it was LDT entry number FFh.</li>
  <li>Looking two lines down, you can see it's 32-bit data which is both
    readable and writeable.&nbsp; It starts at the same address and is the same
    size as the Code Selector, strangly enough.&nbsp; Of course in our past MPs,
    we've set DS to point to the same place as CS.&nbsp; Here these things mean
    something different.</li>
</ul>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="selector_screen.gif" width="493" height="299"></p>
<P>To get the linear address for <samp>mov eax, dword [ds:ebx]</samp>, the processor
will look in the Local Descriptor Table for ds's linear start address.&nbsp; It
then adds the offset (in this case the value in ebx) to get the linear
address.&nbsp; While it's doing this, it checks to see
if you tried to access memory that was beyond the allowed length.&nbsp; Once it
has the linear address, it looks in the processor's Virtual Memory Page Table to
get the physical address, which is what actually gets sent out on the bus.&nbsp;
If the Page table says that the particular page you need is not in physical
memory, it will throw a Page Fault and the Operating System will have to load it
off of disk.&nbsp; (Call swaping.)&nbsp; As you can see, there are a few more
levels of abstraction here.&nbsp; We didn't talk anything about Virtual Memory
or swapping, so this paragraph might go way over some of your heads.&nbsp; Just
wait until 312 (Architecture) and CS 323 (the OS class) to learn all this fun
stuff. </P>

<P>If you did try to access memory &quot;out of range,&quot; when it preformed
that check, the processor will throw a General Protection Fault
and call interrupt 13h.&nbsp; This interrupt goes to the operating system which promptly terminated your program for trying to access memory that it
doesn't own. (This is how memory is <i>protected</i> in protected
mode.&nbsp; Ahhhh!)&nbsp; &quot;So why can't I just go into the Local Descriptor
Table and give my segment a huge length?&quot;&nbsp; You're never allowed to deal with the
Local Descriptor Table directly.&nbsp; You kindly <i>ask</i> the operating
system to find you some free memory and set up your descriptor table. </P>

<P><b>Protected Mode Interrupts<br>
</b>If you want to call a interrupt, you can't just do it.&nbsp; This isn't
16-bit DOS.&nbsp; When an interrupt is called, it does it's processing on the
registers and returns it's values in the registers.&nbsp; To make it so you can
still call real-mode interrupts, DPMI has it set up so you can write the values
of the registers you want to pass to the interrupt in an array, call the
&quot;Simulate Real Mode Interrupt&quot; DPMI call, and get your return
values in your array.&nbsp; The DPMI interrupt is 33h, and the &quot;Simulate
Real Mode Interrupt&quot; subfunction is 300h.&nbsp; (Note that here, the subfunction
number goes in all of AX rather than just AH like the DOS int 21h subfunctions
did.&nbsp; This is completely arbitrary, of course, and up to the
interrupt.)&nbsp; I took this out of <a href="http://www.ece.uiuc.edu/ece291/class-resources/pmode/dpmi/index.html">http://www.ece.uiuc.edu/ece291/class-resources/pmode/dpmi/index.html</a>

<P>The Simulate Real Mode Interrupt service that DPMI provides to you is really
complicated, but basically it drops back to 16-bit mode and sets the registers
to the ones you give it in the array, then calls the 16-bit interrupt, then it
goes back to protected mode and copies the interrupt's return values back into
your array. </P>

<P>This all works nicely when you're just calling something like &quot;get
time&quot; which does thing to the registers, but what about the interrupts like
&quot;Print String&quot; which takes the address of the
string as an input?&nbsp; For this you need to copy your string into a special
buffer you've allocated in DOS's 16-bit memory space (below 1MB) before you call &quot;Simulate Real
Mode Interrupt.&quot;&nbsp; How do you allocate such memory? </P>

<div align="center">

</div>
<P>This call is a good way to see the differences between real-mode segments and
selectors.&nbsp; Later, you'll want to copy your string into the memory you
allocated with this call.&nbsp; To do that, set one of the protected-mode
selector registers to the DX that INT 31h, 0100h returned.&nbsp; For example, <b>mov
gs, dx.</b>&nbsp; To access the fifth byte of the string, you can do <b>[gs:5]</b>.&nbsp;
Eventually you'll give the real-mode segment (what was returned in AX) to the
&quot;DOS Print String interrupt&quot; as DS.&nbsp; To do this, you'll <b>mov
DPMI_DS, ax</b> before you do the &quot;Simulate Real Mode Interrupt&quot;
call.&nbsp; DOS will access the fifth byte as <b>[ds:5]</b>.&nbsp; While this
looks similar, keep in mind that the method for obtaining the actual physical
address is COMPLETELY different in both cases and Allocated DOS Memory Block had
to do quite a bit of work: </P>

<ul>
  <li>Switch&nbsp; to real-mode</li>
  <li>Do a DOS call to allocate the memory that DOS is in charge of (below 1MB)</li>
  <li>Calculate the physical address that DOS returned.</li>
  <li>Set up a new entry in the LDT for this base address and the appropriate
    length.</li>
  <li>Return the index of this LDT entry in DX.</li>
</ul>

<P><b>Protected Mode Handlers<br>
</b>What about your keyboard handler?&nbsp; What about your mouse handler?&nbsp;
What about networking or sound where when something happens on the card, an
interrupt is called?&nbsp; For these situations, your protected mode CODE must
be executed when a real-mode interrupt is fired.&nbsp; This is worth looking
into if you're doing a game, and is talked about in the &quot;Interrupt
Management Services&quot; section of <a href="http://www.ece.uiuc.edu/ece291/class-resources/pmode/dpmi/ch5.g.html">DPMI
Functions by Functional Group</a>. </P>

<P><b>Microsoft-Centric<br>
</b>Keep in mind that this is all very DOS and DPMI specific.&nbsp; Most of what
we've said so far applies to general Intel protected mode programming (Linux
kernel hacking, for example.)&nbsp; The only exceptions are really the stub
stuff and this DOS interrupt stuff through DPMI. </P>

<P><font size="+2"><u>Task 4:&nbsp; Generalizing your Makefile</u></font> </P>

<P><b><i>Another File</i></b>: Call it &quot;<b><samp>interrupt.asm</samp></b>&quot;
because we'll play with the DPMI interrupts.&nbsp; You're going to need the
&quot;BITS 32&quot; &quot;GLOBAL _main&quot; &quot;.bss .data .text
sections&quot; and &quot;_main&quot;&nbsp; If you want to be lazy, just copy <b><samp>variable.asm</samp></b>
and rip out the guts leaving just the framework.&nbsp; Declare the memory for
the register structure that the simulate interrupt will be passed -- Add that <samp>   DPMI_Regs
</samp>definition into your <samp>.bss</samp> section. </P>

<P><b><i>Makefile</i></b>:&nbsp; Change your make file to be able to make the
interrupt.exe executable. A good thing to do would be to change the &quot;<b><samp>variable.exe</samp></b>&quot;
rule into a general &quot;<b><samp>%.exe:</samp></b>&quot; rule that's dependent
on a generic &quot;<b><samp>%.o</samp></b>&quot; object file.&nbsp; You can
model it after your &quot;<b><samp>%.o:</samp></b>&quot; rule, remembering that
&quot;<b><samp>$*</samp></b>&quot; means &quot;the name of the first dependency
without it's file extension.&quot;&nbsp; The second thing to do would be to add
&quot;<b><samp>interrupt.exe</samp></b>&quot; as a dependency in the &quot;<b><samp>all:</samp></b>&quot;
rule so that it too gets made when you type just plain &quot;<b><samp>make</samp></b>&quot;.&nbsp;
If this makes no sense, re-read the section on Makefiles.&nbsp; If this still
makes no sense, e-mail me so I can improve the section on Makefiles so that it
will make sense.&nbsp; This is one of the few places here where you actually
have to think.&nbsp; Remember, it's either this or another Parse. </P>

  </li>
  <li>Then do &quot;<samp>int 31h</samp>&quot; to do the call.</li>

<P>If you recall, the final program sat around and waited for you to press a
key.&nbsp; Then it did some function and came back to waiting for a key.&nbsp;
This is best done with a jump table whose index is the scan code of the key
press.&nbsp; Here.&nbsp; I'll just give you a table so you don't have to look at
all the scan codes: </P>

so that: </P>

  <li>F1 Displays your string</li>
  <li>F2 Displays your string until you hit a key</li>

<p>You need a menu.&nbsp; Just make a big string and print it out.&nbsp; You've
got to make sure you're allocating enough memory in your buffer for the large
menu string.&nbsp; Actually, on second hand, try the program without allocating
enough memory and see what happens.&nbsp; <a href="questions.html">Question 4:</a>&nbsp;
What happened when you didn't allocate enough memory in your buffer?&nbsp; The
memory was protected!&nbsp; (Thus the name of the mode.)</p>

<P><font size="+2"><u>Task 9:&nbsp; Draw Pixels in 320x200 </u></font> </P>

<p>One last thing before we get into the good stuff.&nbsp; You know about this
mode.&nbsp; Let's see how we can use it in protected mode. To get into the mode
is pretty straight forward.&nbsp; Make a new jump table entry for DrawPixels and
put the mode switching code there:</p>
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><samp>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; Switch to 320x200x256 Mode</samp><samp><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mov ah, 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; Subfunction to set the
      mode<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mov al, 13h&nbsp; ; Mode 13h is 320x200x256<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int 10h&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; Video BIOS call<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; Do the pixel stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ; Switch back to text Mode<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mov ah, 0<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mov al, 03h&nbsp; ; Mode 03h is text mode.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int 10h</samp></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The hard part here is that in protected mode, you can't just blindly write to
segment 0A000h.&nbsp; First of all, segments are meaningless. Like you allocated
a block of DOS memory before and got a selector for it, you're going to have to
get a selector for the real-mode memory for the screen.&nbsp; A look at the <a href="http://www.ece.uiuc.edu/ece291/class-resources/pmode/dpmi/ch5.g.html">DPMI
Functions by Functional Group</a> we find <a href="http://www.ece.uiuc.edu/ece291/class-resources/pmode/dpmi/api/310002.html"><tt>31
0002</tt> - Segment to Descriptor</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <td width="100%">
      <p align="center"><b>INT 31h, 0002h - Segment to Descriptor</b>
      <p><b>Inputs:</b><br>
      AX = 0002H (The Segment to Descriptor subfunction)<br>
      BX = real mode segment address<br>
      <br>
      <b>Outputs:</b><br>
      Carry flag = clear if call was successful<br>
      AX = protected mode selector for real mode segment</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<ul>
  <li>Get a selector for 0A000h.</li>
  <li>Go into video mode.</li>
  <li>Draw a bunch of pixels into video memory using the selector you got.&nbsp;
    Some loop with different colors would be nice.</li>
  <li>Wait for a Key Press.&nbsp; (Be sure to read in the key off the buffer
    with <b><samp>int 16h, 00h</samp></b> when you <i>do</i> get a key press.)</li>
  <li>Return to text mode.</li>
</ul>

<p>Make it, run it, look in the Local Descriptor Table (Alt-L) at selector it
gave you.&nbsp; This is the best example of how this selector/descriptor stuff
works because you can actually see a real, meaningful physical address!</p>
