<h2>Introduction</h2>
  This machine problem will introduce you to the computers, 
  network, and software in the ECE291 laboratory.
  For this machine problem, you will learn how to edit, assemble, 
  debug, and execute an existing, simple assembly  language  program.
  A full listing of the program and a Makefile 
  are given at the end of this assignment.  Electronic copies of the
  program are available in the lab or on-line as 
  <a href="mp0.zip">mp0.zip</a>.

<h2>Preliminary Procedure</h2>
<ol>
<li>Visit the ECE291 laboratory in room 238 Everitt Lab.  You
    will need an activated key card to open the door.
<p>
<li>Have a seat at any available computer in the laboratory. 
    The machine should boot into Windows 2000 (if not already on).
<p>
<li>Enter your login and password.  Change your NT login password at
    <a href="http://accounts.ad.uiuc.edu/">http://accounts.ad.uiuc.edu/</a>.
<p>
<li>Start a DOS shell.  This can be done by double clicking on the
    <i>Command Prompt</i> icon on the desktop.
<p>
<li>For the machines in the
    ECE291 lab, you will be using the following drive letters: <p> 
    <table cellpadding=2 border=0 cellspacing=2 width=80%>
    <tr><th bgcolor="#EFEFEF">Drive</th><th bgcolor="#EFEFEF">Description</th>
      <th bgcolor="#EFEFEF">Purpose</th></tr>
    <tr><td bgcolor="#EFEFEF">C:</td>
        <td bgcolor="#EFEFEF">Hard Drive (local)</td>
        <td bgcolor="#EFEFEF">Holds Windows 2000, NASM, and other applications<br>
        <i>Do not store files here!</i></td></tr>
    <tr><td bgcolor="#EFEFEF">V:\ece291\</td>
        <td bgcolor="#EFEFEF">Class Drive (network)</td>
        <td bgcolor="#EFEFEF">Class material, libraries, example code<br>(Read Only)</td></tr>
    <tr><td bgcolor="#EFEFEF">W:</td>
        <td bgcolor="#EFEFEF">Your personal home directory (network)</td>
        <td bgcolor="#EFEFEF">This drive will be mounted each time you log in,<br>
            and is accessible from any machine in the lab.<br>
           (Store your MPs here!)<br>
           </td></tr>
  </table>
<p>
<li>Copy the MP0 directory on the class drive to your private directory
    by typing:<br> 
    <tt>xcopy /s V:\ece291\mp0 W:\mp0</tt><br>
    When prompted, respond with <tt>D</tt> to copy the entire directory.
<p>

<li>Go into your private directory
  <ul>
  <li>Switch to your drive by typing<br>
      <tt>W:</tt>
  <li>Switch to the mp0 directory by typing <br>
      <tt>cd \mp0</tt>
  </ul>
<p>

<li>From the desktop, run <i>Windows Explorer</i>.  Navigate to your
    <tt>W:</tt> drive, open the <tt>mp0</tt> folder
<p>

<li>Double-click on the <tt>MP0</tt> ASM file to edit the program.
    <i>(If you are working at home, you'll need to install your own
    text editor.  Avoid Notepad and QuickEdit like the Plague)</i>.
    Scroll through the program, but don't make any changes yet. <p>

   The code is
   broken into several sections to illustrate the various components
   in  an  assembly program.  This is certainly not the only way  to
   organize an assembly program, but it gives a good starting point.
   Again,  you  do  not  need  to  understand  precisely  what   the
   statements  are  doing  at this point,  but  notice  the  overall
   structure  of  the  program.  This will be a good  reference  for
   future machine problems.<p>
 
   <ul><li>Section 1 defines several constants to be used throughout
   the program.  Each constant has a value that is associated with a
   particular name using the <tt>EQU</tt> statement.</li>

   <li>Section  2 declares external procedures (meaning code  that
   has already been written but is in a different file) that will be
   used in this program.  External procedures are declared with  the
   <tt>EXTERN</tt> statement.</li>

  <li>Section  3  defines a special required structure  called  a
  stack segment.  You will discover why a stack is necessary in the
  future.   The  stack segment is declared using the <tt>SEGMENT stkseg
  STACK</tt> statement.</li>

  <li>Section 4 declares the beginning of the code segment - that
  part  of  the file which contains the program instructions.   The
  code  segment  is  declared using the <tt>SEGMENT code</tt>
  statement.</li>

  <li>Section  5 initializes several variables to be  used.   For
  this  program,  these variables are just sequences of  characters
  called strings.  Variables can be defined using the <tt>DB</tt>
  statement.  It is important that variables are not defined in a
  part of your program that is executed.</li>

  <li>Section 6 contains the code for the program initialization:
  setting up segment registers for the default and stack segments.
  Program execution begins at the <tt>..start:</tt> label.  The program
  execution goes immediately into the MAIN procedure (next section)
  after completing this section.</li>

  <li>Section  7  contains  the  code  for  the  main  procedure.
 </ul><p>


<li>From the DOS window, 
    Assemble and link MP0 by typing <tt>make</tt>.  This command 
    will read <tt>Makefile</tt> and invoke the following commands:  <br>
      <tt>nasm -g -f obj -o mp0.obj mp0.asm -l mp0.lst</tt><br>
      <tt>tlink /c /v mp0.obj, mp0.exe, mp0.map, lib291.lib</tt><br>
    At this point, you should have just created the executable program
    called MP0.EXE.
<p>
 
<li>Run the program by just typing its name, <tt>MP0</tt><br>
  Try giving the program different input.  
  <i>Remember: this program is looking for upper-case letters!</i>
    <p>

<li>Now examine your program by running the debugging tool Turbo Debugger (TD).<br>
  <tt>TD MP0</tt><br>
    Turbo Debugger will read your MP0.EXE program and allow you to step 
    and trace through the program as it executes.
  <p>

  <ul>
  <li>If the <tt>Regs</tt> window is not already open, open it.
      From TD's <i>View</i> pulldown menu, select the options
      to view <tt>Registers</tt>. Resize
      and adjust the locations of the windows on the screen as necessary. <p>

  <li>Click on the function key <tt>F8</tt> to execute
      the first instruction of your program.
      Notice that register AX has changed value.  
      The first instruction
      of  the  program (MOV AX, CS) puts the value of CS into AX.
      Also  notice  that  register  IP, the  instruction  pointer,  has
      changed  value.   It  always specifies the  offset  of  the  next
      instruction  to  be executed.  The instruction displayed  is  the
      next  one  to  be  executed.   <p>

  <li>Click <tt>F8</tt> again to execute the second line of code.
      Notice that the DS register changes.<p>
  
  <li>If the <tt>Dump</tt> window is not already open, open it.
      From TD's <i>View</i> pulldown menu, select the options
      to view <tt>Dump</tt>.  
      Memory addresses are shown on the left in segment:offset format.
      Check that the memory segment is DS.
      If not, you can right click in the Dump window and click on
      <tt>Goto...</tt>.  Type <tt>ds:0</tt> and press Enter to display
      the start of the data segment. 
      Each data byte  appears in hexadecimal.  On the far right side  
      of the screen are  the characters  whose ASCII codes are given 
      by the bytes.
      The ASCII contents of the memory should look familiar.  <p>

  <li>Click on <tt>F8</tt> a few more times to <i>step</i> through your code.
      Stop <i>stepping</i> when you reach the input prompt.    <p>
      
  <li>From the program's grade prompt, select a letter grade.  Use <tt>F8</tt>
      to <i>step</i> through the rest of the program.  You toggle between
      the debugger screen and program output by pressing <tt>Alt-F5</tt>.<p>

  <li>Once the program has terminated; Select <tt>Program reset</tt> from
      TD's <tt>Run</tt> menu.  Run the program again a few times with
      different input until you understand how the program is executing. <p>

  <li>Navigate to the <i>View</i> menu, and select <i>CPU</i>.  Resize and
      adjust the locations of the windows on the screen as necessary.<p>

  <li>Again select <tt>Program reset</tt> from TD's <tt>Run</tt> menu. 
      Right click in the code area of the <i>CPU</i> window, and click on
      the <i>Mixed</i> option until it reads <tt>No</tt>.  Click outside the
      popup menu to make it disappear.
      Now, In TD's <i>CPU</i> window, you will see the machine code
      for the same program.  In first column, you will
      see where each line of code is located in memory 
      (in segment:offset format).  In the second column, you 
      will see the program bytes in hex.  In the third column,
      you will see the human-readable opcodes of the program.
      Notice that text labels have been replaced
      with numeric values (pointers and constants) by the assembler
      and linker.<p>

  <li>Again select <tt>program reset</tt> from TD's <tt>Run</tt> menu.  
      Run the program again a few more times with different input. <p>

  <li>To speed up the debugging process, TD allows the programmer to
      execute large sections of code between <i>break-points</i>.
      Click on the line at offset=00FB and press <tt>F2</tt> to set a
      breakpoint in your program at the first compare statement.<p>

  <li>Restart your program, then hit F9 to 
      <tt>run</tt> through your code until the breakpoint.<p>

  <li>When prompted for a grade, enter <tt>B</tt> then hit return. 
      You should continue execution of the program.<p>

  <li>Record the value in register AL.   <br>
       <table border=0 bgcolor="#efefef"><tr><td>AL = ____</td></tr></table><p>

  <li>In the <tt>Dump</tt> window, change the value of the byte at offset=0 to
         44 (hex).  Continue running the program until it terminates.
          Notice that the output message is grossly incorrect.   <p>

  <li>In the space below, explain what the program is doing.<br>
           <table border=0 BGCOLOR="#efefef" width=75%><tr><td><xmp>  
           
           
           </xmp></td></tr></table>           <p>

   <li>Quit TD and return to the DOS prompt. <p>
  </ul>

   <li>Now return to your text editor to modify mp0.asm.  
       You need to make the following changes: <p>

     <ol>
     <li>Put your name and the current date at the 
         beginning of the program 
     <li>Add a feature to the program
         that prints a message of <i>your choice</i>
         when the grade <tt>C</tt> is selected.  <br>
     <li>Assemble and test your program with all possible inputs.  
         Debug with TD  
         as necessary until the program works as expected. 
     </ol>   <p>
     
   <li>Now return to your text editor and add a line to mp0.asm. 
         <p>
       
       <ol>
       <li>Add a new variable to your program called <i>mystery</i> that  
           is initialized with the hex values of 0FEh,0C0h.  
           <i>(This is NASM's method of entering hex values)</i>.
       
           Declare this variable at the location in your code
           immediately after the input is read using the lib291 
           <i>kbdine</i> function.
       <li>Re-Assemble your code and run TD.
       <li>Run your program a few more times and observe what happens.
           Try Switching between the <i>Module</i> (source) window and
           <i>CPU</i> (disassembly) windows.
       <li>Browse the CPU window 
           record what addresses the <i>mystery</i> bytes 
           were stored in.     <br>
           <table border=0 bgcolor="#efefef"><tr><td>Address= ______ : ______ </td></tr></table>
       <li>In the space below, explain how the program behaves differently and why.    <br>
           <table border=0 bgcolor="#efefef" width=75%><tr><td><xmp>
           
           
           
           </xmp></td></tr></table>
       <li>Finally, Move this variable declaration to where it belongs in the code.
      </ol>  <p>
 
                                                               
 </ol>
 </ol>




<h2>Final Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Demonstrate your updated MP0.EXE to a TA or to the instructor.
  Review your solutions to the question with the TA.
  Be prepared to be quizzed by the TA with additional questions 
  about your TD debugging experiences.    The TA will not allow you
  to submit your MP until he or she is satisified that you have mastered 
  TD.<p>

  <p>

<li>Have the TA handin your MP online.
  <p>

<li>Log off by clicking on the <i>start</i> button and 
    navigating to <i>Shutdown</i> and selecting <i>Log off</i>.
  </ul>   
  <p>

<li>You are now finished!

; MP0 - Your Name - Today's Date
;
;       This program illustrates a (very) basic assembly program and
;       the use of LIB291 input and output routines.
;       By working on this code, you will have the opportunity to 
;       exercise the tools for this class, namely the editor, 
;       the Assembler (NASM), and the debugger (TD).
;       Be sure to put your name in the places where it says 'Your Name' 
;       and also  change the date where it says 'Today's Date'.  
;       The changes that you need to make to this program are 
;       described in the MP0 assignment page.
