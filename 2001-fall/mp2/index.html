<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>After reeling from several thousand dollars of debt to the Illini
Union Bank, you get a strange feeling that something was not right.  The
Illini Union Bank was not paying interest on its accounts!</p>

<p>It's time to fix this major oversight.  The IUB is still expecting
the unwitting engineering students to work out the minor flaws in its
original roll-out, such as the inability to collect from students who
have taken out several $4096 withdrawals.  Of course, we don't want to
fix <em>that</em> bug.</p>

<h2>Problem Description</h2>

<p>Now no longer working with the front end to the bank ledger, we will
instead work with back-end functionality.  The back-end interface takes
individual commands that work on <em>fixed-point</em> decimal values.
The operations it supports are as follows:</p>

<ul>

 <li>Compound Interest Calculation 
 

 <p>Your money in a bank account that earns interest is often compounded
 monthly on a yearly percentage.  The formula that governs this is:</p>

 <blockquote>A = P (1+(i/m))<sup>n m</sup>,</blockquote>

 <p>where <em>P</em> is the principal, <em>i</em> is the interest per
 cycle, and <em>m</em> is number of periods in a cycle.  For our MP's
 purposes we don't want to implement division; we will pre-divide out
 <em>i/m</em>, and pre-multiply the exponent <em>n m</em>.  Thus our
 simplified equation is:</p>

 <blockquote>A = P (1+i)<sup>n</sup>,</blockquote>

 <p>where <em>i</em> is now the interest per period, and <em>n</em> is
 the number of periods.</p>

 <li>Currency Conversion 
 

 <p>The Illini Union Bank is looking to set up branches in several
 countries.  At each of these branches they will allow you to withdraw
 your money in the local currency.  In order to know how much to give
 you, their backend must support currency conversions.</p>

 <p>To convert between currencies, the IUB is converting through
 dollars.  The formula to convert between arbitrary currencies is as
 follows:</p>

 <blockquote>A = P (from X to dollars) (from dollars to Y)</blockquote>

 <p>These conversion rates are stored in tables, allowing for easy
 lookup.</p> </li>

</ul>

<h2>Fixed Point Decimal Numbers</h2>

<p>Since we want to read, work with, and store numbers that look like
102.34, we need to define a representation and to write functions to
perform useful math on them.  First we'll address the representation we
will be using, and then we'll address what functions we need to write
and how to write them.</p>

<h3>Representation</h3>

<p>One way to store these numbers is by storing a larger number that is
100 times larger than the stored number.  For example to store our
number 102.34, we'd store the binary for 10234, and divide off the 34 to
display it.  As it turns out, doing it this way would make it hard to
use <tt>ascbin</tt>, <tt>binasc</tt>, and other assorted functions since
we would need to store more than 16 bits to keep the same range our
normal 16 bit numbers have.</p>

<p>To address these size issues, we will instead use a object which is
32 bits large.  In one half we will store the integer component.  In the
other half, we will store the decimal component multiplied by 100, with
a maximum value of 99.  The number 102.34 would be stored with the two
word-sized numbers 102 and 34.  The primary advantage to doing it this
way is that our normal tools will work, <tt>ascbin</tt> and
<tt>binasc</tt> in particular.</p><!--<p>See the <a href="rep.html">additional</a> information for detailed
diagrams and several examples.</p>-->

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>For the financial calculations in this MP we need several basic
utility functions.  These include the following:</p>

<h4>FDRead</h4>

<p>To do any work with a FDNumber, we must first read it in.  While
<tt>ascbin</tt> can turn a string into a number, this only works for
integers.  <tt>FDRead</tt> must handle numbers that look like
<tt>102</tt>, <tt>102.3</tt>, and <tt>102.34</tt>.  To do this, you will
probably wish to call <tt>ascbin</tt> on the components and then store
them into the appropriate halves of the FDNumber.</p>

<p><tt>FDRead</tt> must report success and error cases like
<tt>ascbin</tt> does.  Unlike <tt>ascbin</tt> the output is in the
FDNumber pointed to by <tt>di</tt>, and <tt>ax</tt> should remain
unchanged.</p>

<p>Special cases to be aware of:</p>

<ul>

 <li><tt>102</tt> with no decimal. 
  Don't forget to zero the decimal portion. 
 

 <li><tt>102.</tt> with a trailing decimal point cannot be handled
 easily due to the way <tt>ascbin</tt> functions. 
 

 <p>If you choose to handle this, expect to do something unusual.  If
 you do not choose to handle these, expect debugging such numbers to not
 work as you may expect.</p>

 <li><tt>102.3</tt> with a single 
  digit after the decimal point. 
 

 <p>When a single digit occurs after the decimal point, it needs to be
 multiplied by 10, as otherwise the 3 will be 3/100, not 3/10.  One way
 to handle this is by tracking the change <tt>bx</tt> across calls to
 <tt>ascbin</tt> and acting accordingly.</p>   

 <li><tt>102.345</tt> a decimal 
  portion too large; these numbers are illegal in our limited framework. 
 

 <li><tt>102.003</tt> a decimal portion too long; these cannot easily
 be detected, except perhaps by similar means to the <tt>102.3</tt>
 case.  Just know that these numbers are not handled correctly, and you
 don't have to.</li>

</ul>

<h4>FDWrite</h4>

<p>After reading in a number, it's good to be able to display the number
to a curious user.  Just as <tt>FDRead</tt> can be implemented with two
calls to <tt>ascbin</tt> with additional logic, <tt>FDWrite</tt> can be
implemented as two calls to <tt>binasc</tt> also with additional
logic.</p>

<p><tt>FDWrite</tt> must match <tt>binasc</tt> in terms of outputs, with
<tt>bx</tt> pointing to the first non-blank character in the
<strong>10</strong>-byte buffer, and <tt>cl</tt> holding the number of
non-blank characters in the generated string.</p>

<p>The only special case to <tt>FDWrite</tt> is for numbers like 102.03.
Since <tt>binasc</tt> will generate the string
<tt>"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3$"</tt>, you must manually add the
prepended zero.  You may find it useful to use an additional buffer to
write parts of the numbers and copy them into the final buffer pointed
to by <tt>bx</tt>.</p>

<h4>FDAdd</h4>

<p>Reading and writing FDNumbers is nice, but now let's do some math.
Adding two numbers is very straightforward, and is good practice for the
more complicated operations we will be doing next.</p>

<p>If you consider the two FDNumbers <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, with
corresponding pieces <em>A<sub>h</sub></em>, <em>A<sub>l</sub></em>,
<em>B<sub>h</sub></em>, and <em>B<sub>l</sub></em> such that
<em>A</em>=<em>A<sub>h</sub></em>+<em>A<sub>l</sub></em>/100. Their sum
<em>S</em> is calculated as follows:</p>

<blockquote> S<sub>h</sub> = A<sub>h</sub>+B<sub>h</sub><br>
             S<sub>l</sub> = A<sub>l</sub>+B<sub>l</sub><br>
</blockquote>

<p>Except one thing: <em>A<sub>l</sub></em>+<em>B<sub>l</sub></em> may
exceed 99, but <em>S<sub>l</sub></em> is not allowed to.  In such cases,
for every 100 in <em>S<sub>l</sub></em>, subtract it out and add 1 to
<em>S<sub>h</sub></em>.  You may find it more intuitively obvious to do
this with <tt>div</tt> or you may not.</p>

<p>Note that <tt>FDAdd</tt> reads from the FDNumbers at offsets
<tt>si</tt> and <tt>di</tt> and writes to the FDNumber at offset
<tt>di</tt>, much like an <tt>add [di], [si]</tt> might function if it
were possible.</p>

<h4>FDMul</h4>

<p>Multiplication is an extension of adding.  Consider again two such
numbers <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, separated as above.  Their product
<em>P</em> is calculated much like you would calculated the product
(x+y)(x-y)</p>

<blockquote> P<sub>h</sub> = A<sub>h</sub>*B<sub>h</sub> +
			     A<sub>h</sub>*B<sub>l</sub>/100 +
			     A<sub>l</sub>*B<sub>h</sub>/100<br>
             P<sub>l</sub> = A<sub>h</sub>*B<sub>l</sub>%100 +
			     A<sub>l</sub>*B<sub>h</sub>%100 +
			     A<sub>l</sub>*B<sub>l</sub>/100,
</blockquote>

<p>where <em>x % 100</em> is the remainder when <em>x</em> is divided by
100, or its modulus.</p>

<p>Note that <em>A<sub>l</sub></em>*<em>B<sub>l</sub></em> % 100 may be
greater than or equal to 50.  In such cases <em>P<sub>l</sub></em>
should be incremented, and such changes should be propagated through to
<em>P<sub>h</sub></em> as necessary.</p>

<p>The additions in the formula for <em>P</em> may be done by calling
<tt>FDAdd</tt> or you may find it easier to implement them manually.</p>

<h4>FDPow</h4>

<p><tt>FDPow</tt> is our exponentiation operator.  In an algorithms
class you may have become acquainted with the recursive algorithm we
will be using.  Don't worry if you haven't, as we describe it fully
here.</p>

<p>Recursive algorithms work by defining a base case and an iterative
step.  The Fibonacci function is the classic example: the base cases are
F(0)=0 and F(1)=1.  For all other F(n), F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).  Thus
when finding F(12), it recursively can ask for F(10) and F(11).  Once F(10)
and F(11) return their answers, the body for the Fibonacci function can
add them together and return the final answer for F(12).</p>

<p>Applying this back to the problem at hand: we have a number
<em>b</em> which we wish to raise to the <em>n</em>th power.  The base
case is <em>b</em> raised to the first power, or merely <em>b</em>
itself.  Thus when <tt>FDPow</tt> is called with exponent 1, it can
return the base as the answer without further calculations.  The
recursive step is one of two things, depending on whether the exponent
is an even or odd number:

<blockquote> b<sup>n</sup> = b * b<sup>n/2</sup> * b<sup>n/2</sup>,</blockquote>

<p>for all odd <span class="update"><em>n</em></span>, and truncated values <em>n/2</em>, or</p>

<blockquote> b<sup>n</sup> = b<sup>n/2</sup> * b<sup>n/2</sup>,</blockquote>

<p>for all even <span class="update"><em>n</em></span>.</p>

<p>Once these cases are all handled, i.e. <em>n</em>=1, and all even or
odd numbers above 1, the nature of recursion (or the Recursion Fairy,
according to Professor <a href="http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/~jeffe/">Jeff
Erickson</a>, who should know) will give you your final answer almost
magically.  The only trick is the actual implementation of recursion in
assembly.  Where high level languages will automagically keep your
inputs and outputs separate, assembly style procedures make use of
single pieces of hardware (registers) for both input and outputs.</p>

<div class="update">
<strong>UPDATE (9/18)</strong> The library code now handles an additional base case <em>n</em>=0.
You are encouraged, but not required, to handle it as well.  The proper
return value is <tt>1.00</tt>.
</div>

<p><tt>FDPow</tt> takes two addresses as input.  Like the previous
functions they are <tt>si</tt> and <tt>di</tt>.  Unlike the previous
functions, we neither store back to the number at offset <tt>di</tt>,
nor is the operation commutative: <em>a<sup>n</sup></em> is not
<em>n<sup>a</sup></em>.  The convention we have instead chosen is to
calculate <tt>[di]<sup>[si]</sup></tt>, storing the result in
<tt>dx:ax</tt>.  Store the integer portion in <tt>dx</tt> and the
hundredths in <tt>ax</tt>.</p>

<p>Note: thinking recursively takes practice.  The same code must
function correctly whether it is called with 1, 4, or n as the exponent.
And more importantly, since it calls itself, anything it writes to will
be similarly written to by its recursive call.  In general you can work
around this by pushing values to the stack and restoring them from the
stack as the recursive procedure exits.  Don't give up!</p>

<h2>Input Handling</h2>

<p>Now that we've got a set representation and several utility functions
for our fixed-point decimal numbers, it's time to write the rest of the
program that makes it possible to use them.  To perform a compound
interest calculation or currency conversion, the user will type
something like: <tt>i 100 0.03 12</tt>, which represents a starting
value of $100, at a 3% interest rate, compounded 12 times.  How do we
read this command in and then process it?</p>

<p>There are four parts to this answer: <tt>DoCommand</tt>,
<tt>ReadLine</tt>, <tt>GetLetter</tt>, and <tt>GetNumber</tt>.
Additionally, once a command line is understood, either
<tt>CalculateInterest</tt> or <tt>ConvertCurrency</tt> is called to
handle the computation.</p>

<h3>DoCommand</h3>

<p><tt>DoCommand</tt> is the heart of the operation.  It performs all
the steps necessary to do one calculation.  It will orchestrate the
reading of a line of input data, the matching pieces to either an
interest or currency calculation, the dispatching of this data to the
corresponding computational function, and error checking in several
steps.</p>

<p>In particular <tt>DoCommand</tt> must call <tt>ReadLine</tt> with
pointers set to the appropriate buffer (<tt>tbuf</tt>, for typing
buffer).  If no characters are read, it must call <tt>ReadLine</tt>
again until some are.  Then <tt>DoCommand</tt> must call various
patterns of <tt>GetLetter</tt> and <tt>GetNumber</tt> to parse out a
command.</p>

<p>The first item in the line must be either <tt>i</tt>, <tt>c</tt>,
or <tt>q</tt>.  If it reads <tt>q</tt>, then <tt>DoCommand</tt> must
return a 0 so the main loop will know to quit.  If instead it reads
<tt>i</tt>, it must then read three fixed-point decimal numbers, the
principle, the interest rate, and the number of periods, respectively.
<tt>DoCommand</tt> can then call <tt>CalculateInterest</tt> and print
the result.</p>

<p>Correspondingly, if the first letter is <tt>c</tt>,
<tt>DoCommand</tt> must get two more letters, and a number.  These are,
in order, the originating currency, the resulting currency, and the
amount in the original currency.  For instance, <tt>c d c 100.30</tt>
represents a conversion from 100.30 US dollars to Canadian dollars.</p>

<p>For any other first letters, including of course any non-letters that
cause <tt>GetLetter</tt> to return an error, <tt>DoCommand</tt> must
report an error.  The help message should be provided at this point in
time.</p>

<p>If any of the <tt>GetNumber</tt> or <tt>GetLetter</tt> calls returns
an error, or if the call to the computational function returns an error,
<tt>DoCommand</tt> should display the error message (but no help
message), and exit with a nonzero value in <tt>ax</tt> to indicate not
to quit.  Otherwise if no errors occur, <tt>DoCommand</tt> should print
out the result (preceded by the result message, of course).</p>

<h3>ReadLine</h3>

<p>Before we can retrieve any values from the string which the user
inputs, we must read the string into a buffer.  There are several
important details to this function, so read carefully!</p>

<ul>

 <li>Ignore linefeed characters (<tt>LF</tt>) 
 

 <p>LF characters are part of a file stored in the disk, generated as
 one of two characters for every newline (think Enter or Return) stored
 in the file.  By ignoring this we can take files as test inputs.</p>

 <li>Handle Backspace (<tt>BS</tt>) 
 

 <p>When the users make a mistake in typing, chances are they will hit
 the Backspace key.  In general we want to make this delete the previous
 character, perhaps in memory just decreasing our length counter.  To
 actually delete the character on the screen, however, we must display a
 backspace to move back, a space to remove the displayed character, and
 a second backspace to move back once again.</p>

 <p>Note that the backspace should result in a beep when pressed at the
 beginning of the buffer, and should work normally when pressed at the
 end of the buffer.</p>

 <li>End input upon Enter (<tt>CR</tt>) 
 

 <p>When the user presses Enter, <tt>ReadLine</tt> must place a
 <tt>'$'</tt> at the spot where the <tt>CR</tt> would otherwise go, and
 return with the appropriate outputs.  Enter should be accepted at any
 point along the line, including an empty or a full buffer.</p>

 <li>Don't overflow the buffer 
 

 <p>One of your inputs is the length of your buffer.  Don't write to
 more memory than this value indicates, as it can corrupt essential
 data.  Chances are you won't trigger this problem in normal use, but
 expect the TA to check it.  When the user presses a normal key (other
 than one of the above) and the buffer is full, <tt>ReadLine</tt> must
 beep and not change the buffer's contents.</p>

 <li>Everything else 
 

 <p>Chances are anything else should just be copied into the buffer and
 echoed to the screen.  If you find that you wish to improve the user
 experience by limiting user input to valid letters and numbers only,
 you may do so (it must still accept <tt>CR</tt>, <tt>BS</tt>, and
 <tt>LF</tt> as above, though).</p> </li>

</ul>

<p>Note the inputs and outputs; you're given a buffer address and size,
and must return a (partially) filled buffer, and a count of filled
characters.  Prompt the user by displaying "<tt>&gt;&nbsp;</tt>" but do
not place it in the buffer.  Don't forget to write to the screen.</p>

<h3>GetLetter</h3>

<p>The purpose of <tt>GetLetter</tt> is simple.  Ignoring any
intervening spaces, it should return in <tt>al</tt> the ASCII value of
the first letter at or after offset <tt>bx</tt>.  If the first value
which is not a space is not a letter, it should return <tt>ax=0</tt>
instead to indicate an error.  <tt>GetLetter</tt> should also update
<tt>bx</tt> to point to the character after the letter it returned.</p>

<h3>GetNumber</h3>

<p><tt>GetNumber</tt> functions similarly to <tt>GetLetter</tt>.  It
receives as input the offset of (part of) a string, and returns in
<tt>ax</tt> a value indicating whether it was successful.  Instead of
returning a successful letter in <tt>al</tt>, however,
<tt>GetLetter</tt> places the read number in the memory located at
offset <tt>di</tt>; <tt>di</tt> is an input to <tt>GetNumber</tt>.</p>

<h3>CalculateInterest</h3>

<p>Calculate the interest by calling appropriate <tt>FD<em>x</em></tt>
functions and manipulating pointers correctly.  To be fully functional,
<tt>CalculateInterest</tt> may not write to any of its inputs.  If
necessary, however, it may use other buffers such as the pre-declared
<tt>numbuf1</tt>.  Remember that the equation that we are using is:</p>

<blockquote><tt>[result]</tt> = <tt>[principle]</tt> *
(1+<tt>[interest]</tt>)<sup><tt>[periods]</tt></sup></blockquote>

<p>Note that large numbers, especially as the exponent, can cause
overflows.  You do not have to handle these; merely understand why the
occur with large numbers</p>

<h3>ConvertCurrency</h3>

<p>Converting currency is probably a longer procedure than calculating
interest, but mostly because it must validate its input.  The two
currencies chosen are represented with letters in <tt>dh</tt> and
<tt>dl</tt>.  You must make sure that the provided arguments are really
letters because you must then use them as indices in the lookup-tables
<tt>tab_from</tt> and <tt>tab_to</tt>.  Furthermore, if the value you
retrieve from the table is <tt>0</tt>, it means the user has requested
an invalid currency.  Otherwise it is the address of a FDNumber as found
online last week.  The equation for currency conversion is:</p>

<blockquote><tt>[result]</tt> = 
  from</TT> * <tt>to</tt> *
<tt>[principle]</tt>,</blockquote>

<p>where <em>from</em> and <em>to</em> are the values looked up in
<tt>tab_from</tt> and <tt>tab_to</tt> respectively.

<p>Note: on any invalid input <tt>ConvertCurrency</tt> must signal
error.  Like <tt>CalculateInterest</tt>, <tt>ConvertCurrency</tt> should
not write to any of its inputs, and instead should write to
<tt>[result]</tt>.

  <br><tt>si</tt> = offset to a source FDNumber<br>
     <tt>di</tt> = offset to a source and destination FDNumber
<br><strong>Outputs:</strong>
  <br><tt>[di]</tt> = holds the result of the addition
<br><strong>Purpose: Adds the FDNumbers at offsets di, si and stores at offset di</strong>
<br><strong>Note:</strong>
  <br>When the decimal portion exceeds 99, the overflow must be transferred
  into the integer portion of the FDNumber

<h3>FDMul</h3>
<strong>Inputs:</strong>
  <br><tt>si</tt> = offset to a source FDNumber<br>
     <tt>di</tt> = offset to a source and destination FDNumber
<br><strong>Outputs:</strong>
  <br><tt>[di]</tt> = holds the result of the multiplication
<br><strong>Purpose: Multiplies the FDNumbers at offsets di, si and stores at offset di</strong>
<br><strong>Calls:</strong>
  <br>FDAdd, optionally
<br><strong>Note:</strong>
  <br>Round to the nearest hundredth by turning .005 and higher into .01<br>
  You may find it useful to use a scratch FDNumber or two

<h3>FDPow</h3>
<strong>Inputs:</strong>
  <br><tt>si</tt> = offset to a source FDNumber as exponent<br>
     <tt>di</tt> = 
  offset to a source FDNumber as base
<br><strong>Outputs:</strong>
  <br><tt>dx</tt> = integer portion of the result<br>
     <tt>ax</tt> = the hundredths portion of the result
<br><strong>Purpose: raises [di] to the [si] power</strong>
<br><strong>Calls:</strong>
<br>FDMul
<br><strong>Note:</strong>
  <br>Recursion takes practice<br>
  Ignore the non-integer portion of <tt>[si]</tt> if there is one

<H2>Hints</H2>
<ul>

  <li>The libmp2 file contains executable library functions 
  for each of the routines that you need to implement. This allows you to run 
  the program and understand how it works before you implement it. You can test 
  your program by stepping through&nbsp;it and making sure the display and 
  comparison functions work correctly. You will only receive credit, however, 
  for the routines that you implement yourself. 

  <li>When debugging your code in Turbo Debugger, you will 
  find it helpful to use the memory window to show you the memory location of 
  the file and strings. You can also use the watch window to keep track of 
  variables in your code. 

  <li>Run the program many times to get a good feel of 
  it.&nbsp; Your final program with your code should resemble our version.&nbsp; 
  Formatting aesthetics aren't as important as correctly operating code. 

  <li>Do not forget to push and pop to avoid clobbering 
  registers! 

  <li>Push and Pop can also be used on memory, as long as 
  you specify the size and it's word-sized or larger. You don't have to move it 
  into a register first. (Yes, this does appear to break the two-memory access 
  rule. Don't worry!) 

  <li>Remember to include function headers for&nbsp;and 
  write comments in each of your functions!&nbsp; Headers should give a general 
  idea of what the function does and have a list of inputs, outputs, and called 
  functions.&nbsp; Commenting should be specific enough to allow a function to 
  be understood by just reading the comments.&nbsp; Commenting every line, 
  however, is excessive and may cost you some points. 

  <li>START EARLY! 

  <li>Monitor the <A href="news:uiuc.class.ece291">newsgroup</a> for
clarifications and help.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You will begin this MP with the following files:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>MP2.ASM</tt>: Program Framework
    <li><tt>Makefile</tt>: Specifies how and when programs are assembled and
    linked.
    <li><tt>libmp2.lib</tt>: Library functions for MP2
    <li><tt>lib291.lib</tt>: General-purpose library functions </li></ul>
  <li>You may copy these files from the network drive to your home directory
  with the following command: <br><tt>xcopy /s V:\ece291\mp2 W:\mp2</tt><br>or
  download the files from this server as <A href="mp2.zip">mp2.zip</A>
  <li>Add your code to <tt>MP2.ASM</tt>.
  <li>Assemble and link your program by typing<br><tt>make</tt><br>This command
  reads <em>Makefile</em> then invokes NASM and LINK to build an executable
  program.
  <li>Use Turbo Debugger (TD) to find and correct program errors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Steps</h2>
<ol>

  <li>Demonstrate your MP2.EXE to a TA. You may be asked to 
  recompile and demo the program. Your program must work with all given input. 

  <li>Be prepared to answer questions about any aspect of 
  the operation of your program. The TAs will not accept an MP if you cannot 
  fully explain your code and your implementation. Delayed MPs will be subject 
  to late penalties as described in the course syllabus (10% pts per day). 

  <li>The TA will complete the code submission procedure.</li>

</ol>
