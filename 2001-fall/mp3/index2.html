<h2>
Introduction</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>
This MP will introduce you to text-mode video,&nbsp; interrupt service
routines, and serial communication.&nbsp; You will need to develop a firm
understanding of these concepts in order to complete it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>
Problem Description</h2>

<center><img SRC="mp3.gif" BORDER=0></center>

<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font size="3">In this MP, we're going to hook into the computer's keyboard
  and timer interrupts, to run some of the code asynchronously from the main
  loop. Asynchronously means, in this sense, that you never know ahead of time
  when it will run. You could have two move opcodes, or a compare and a
  conditional jump, and either could be interrupted to run the Interrupt Service
  Routine (ISR). More on this shortly.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
Implementation</h2>
<h3>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
  <h3> Interrupt Service Routines</h3>
  <p>Hardware Interrupts are generated when various hardware events occur.&nbsp;
  Examples include the timer, which triggers 18.2 times per second, the
  keyboard, which triggers for every key press and release, the serial port,
  which depending on the interrupt enable register, triggers each time the
  receive buffer is full, and the mouse which
  triggers for any movement or button press or release. These interrupts are the
  hardware's way of saying &quot;I need attention,&quot; so that the rest of the
  time the CPU can completely ignore such devices, and just execute code.</p>
  <p>When the interrupt happens, the CPU is informed.&nbsp; The current opcode
  finishes execution, and then the current program is interrupted. This is when
  your interrupt service routine (ISR) is executed. As it happens between two effectively random lines of your program,
  the ISR needs to save all registers and the flags. The hardware takes care of
  part of this (by pushing of
  the flags); the rest you must take care of by using IRET instead of RET (to pop the
  flags), and saving your registers like normal.</p>
  <h3>Text-Mode Video</h3>
  <p>We will be using memory mapped I/O.&nbsp; Which means that you will want to
  move 0B800h into ES and explicitly make it your segment when writing to&nbsp;
  the screen. e.g. [es:bx].&nbsp; Remember that each character in text-mode
  video has both an attribute and an ascii component.&nbsp; The size of the
  screen is 80 by 25 characters.&nbsp; Consult lecture eleven of this semester
  for more details on how text-mode video works.&nbsp; We will also be calling
  interrupt 10h with ah=2 to set the cursor position in several functions.</p>
  <h3>The Keyboard ISR</h3>
  <p>When our keyboard handler is called, we know a key has been pressed or
  released. Unfortunately, we don't know what key, whether it was pressed or
  released, and whether the press is a true press or an auto-repeat press.
  There's no way for us find out the last (except keeping track), but
  as for which key and press or release, we can (and must) find this out by
  asking the keyboard for the scancode. See section 10.1.2.2 of the&nbsp; lab
  manual for information on retrieving these scancodes. The
  pages after that describe how scancodes work.</p>
<p>If you look at the scancodes and then at the ascii table, the first
  thing you'll probably notice is that there's no connection. If you then look
  down at the keyboard, however, you may notice a general correlation between
  the scancode and the location of the key, with ESC being scancode 1, and the
  numbers following an increasing pattern. We will be using two look-up tables
to convert the scancodes into their ascii equivalent.&nbsp; We will also
maintain two bits to tell us the state of the shift keys at all times.&nbsp; One
bit will tell us whether the left shift is currently pressed and the other the
same information about the right shift.&nbsp; Of course we have to update the
bits accordingly when shift keys are pressed or released.</p>
  <h3>Serial Communication</h3>
  <p>There is a simple asynchronous transfer protocol that governs how data is
  transmitted over the serial port.&nbsp; Basically there is a port, either
  COM1BASE or COM2BASE, that is written the data value to be transmitted.&nbsp;
  The other port is read by the receiving program after it determines that there
  is something to be read.&nbsp; To determine this, it just looks at a certain
  bit of a register at another port.&nbsp; I am being deliberately vague to get
  the main idea of polled I/O across.&nbsp; Essentially, check a certain bit to
  determine if there is data available to read; if there is then read it.</p>
<p>Well your job in this MP will be harder because instead of polled I/O you
will be using interrupt driven I/O.&nbsp; But it is a very similar concept. It
boils down to setting up an interrupt service routine (ISR) that gets triggered
if there is data available to be read; if there is then read it and say that you
did.&nbsp; The hard part is setting up the ISR in the first place.&nbsp; What
this entails is setting the baud rate, basically how fast the information is
being sent, the data size, unmasking the ISR, and setting up information about
when the ISR is triggered.&nbsp; Each of these things is done by writing to I/O
ports.&nbsp; Looking in section 10.1.2.2 will show you examples of writing to
and reading from ports.</p>
<p>Okay now to get down to the details.&nbsp; I got the following table from <a name="13">http://www.beyondlogic.org/serial/serial.htm<br>

<font size="-1">Table 5 : Table of Registers</font></center><p>All the registers
associated with a certain port are just offsets from that port's base
address.&nbsp; For the two ports we will be using the base addresses are given
as constants, namely COM1BASE and COM2BASE.&nbsp; There are actually twelve
logical registers associated with each serial port, but only eight actual
registers.&nbsp; This is possible because depending on the value of DLAB, some
registers, base address+0 and +1, mean two different things.&nbsp; Also a
register may have a different meaning depending on whether the operation is a
read or write.&nbsp; Incidentally, the page I got this table from is a pretty
decent resource.</p>
<p>DLAB is just the most significant bit of the Line Control Register and can
thus be set or cleared rather easily simply by writing to port COMxBASE+3.&nbsp;
The least significant bit of the Interrupt Enable Register when set causes the
ISR to be jumped to only when the Receiver Buffer is full.&nbsp;</p>

<font size="-1">Table 6 : Table of Commonly Used Baudrate Divisors</font></center><p>I
got this table from the same website. We will want a baud rate of 9600 BPS, so
we need to clear the Divisor Latch High Byte and set the Divisor Latch Low Byte
to 0Ch.&nbsp; Luckily, the Divisor Latch High Byte defaults to 00h, so we only
need to set the Low Byte.&nbsp; Also the IRQs for both ports start masked.&nbsp;
What this means is that those IRQs are essentially out of use.&nbsp; To unmask
them just write a 0 in port 21h.&nbsp; This feels kind of sloppy but it does the
job.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>FIFO</h3>
<p>A queue is a very simple data structure.&nbsp; It can be modeled by an array,
an offset into it representing the oldest element, and a variable representing
the number of elements currently in the array.&nbsp; Of course the elements in
the array are cyclically ordered.&nbsp; The rest of the details I am sure you
can figure out on your own.&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>The Lookup Tables</h3>
<p>Lookup tables are an efficient way to translate one set of inputs to another
set of outputs as seen with currency conversions in MP2.&nbsp; In this MP
QwertyNames and QwertyShift will be used to translate a scancode into its
appropriate ASCII, while colorTable will be used to translate the function keys
to the appropriate color.&nbsp; The outputs for the ascii values of the function
keys from the lookup tables have been arbitrarily set to be 200 through
209.&nbsp; In this MP we will be using the following two
  lookup tables:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>QwertyNames</code>
      <ul>
        <li>This table is designed to facilitate converting scan codes into
          their equivalent ascii characters.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><code>QwertyShift</code></li>
	<ul>
	 <li>This table is designed to facilitate converting scan codes into
          their equivalent ascii shift characters.</li>
	</ul>
    <li><code>colorTable</code>
      <ul>
        <li>Each entry in colorTable is a byte representing an attribute in
          text-mode video.</li>
      </ul>
      &nbsp;
    </li>
  </ul>

          <li>Remember the library doesn't backspace unto the previous line, so
            you don't have to either.</li>
          <li>The library doesn't use dx, but if you want to implement
            backspacing to the previous line you will need dx.</li>
          <li>Remember di is always the offset from the upper left corner of the
            screen.</li>

<h2>General Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The serial communication cable that you will need may not already be
    hooked-up to a free computer in the lab.&nbsp; If this happens just talk to
    a TA.</li>
  <li>Remember to save and restore all modified registers that are not outputs.</li>
  <li>Remember to start early! This MP has more difficult concepts, but when you
    understand them, it is easier to code then the last one.</li>
  <li>Monitor the newsgroup!&nbsp; There may be corrections made on this
    write-up or on the newsgroup.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You will begin this MP with the following files:
    <ul>
      <li><tt>MP3.ASM</tt>: Program Framework
      <li><tt>Makefile</tt>: Specifies how and when programs are assembled and
        linked.
      <li><tt>LIBMP3.LIB</tt>: Library functions for MP3
      <li><tt>LIB291.LIB</tt>: General-purpose library functions</li>
    </ul>
  <li>
  <p align="left">You may copy these files from the network drive to your home directory
    with the following command:<br>
    <tt>xcopy /s V:\ece291\mp3 W:\mp3 <br>
  </tt>or download the files from this server as
  <a href="http://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece291/mp/mp3/mp3.zip">mp3.zip</a><br>
  <li>Add your code to <tt>MP3.ASM</tt>.
  <li>Assemble and link your program by typing<br>
    <tt>make</tt><br>
    This command reads <i>Makefile</i> then invokes NASM and LINK to build an
    executable program.
  <li>Use Turbo Debugger (TD) to find and correct program errors.
  <li>Verify your program operation by testing the input test file. You should
    alter the test file to check different scenarios with your code.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Final Steps</h2>
<p>1. Demonstrate your MP3.EXE to a TA. You may be asked to recompile and demo
the program. Your program must work with all given input.</p>
<p>2. Be prepared to answer questions about any aspect of the operation of your
program. The TAs will not accept an MP if you cannot fully explain your code and
your implementation. Delayed MPs will be subject to late penalties as described
in the course syllabus (10/pts per day).</p>
<p>3. The TA will complete the code submission procedure.</p>
