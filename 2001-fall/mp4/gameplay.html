<h1>Gameplay</h1>
The game board is represented as a two-dimensional array, 16x24 in size, and
is stored in the GameBoard variable. There is a border of size 1 around all four
sides of the board, the walls are of size 1, and the space in which the
pieces can move is 12x20.&nbsp; There is also another row at the top of the
board, the reason for which we'll get to later.&nbsp; This array contains both zero and non-zero values. Zero values
in the GameBoard array indicate cells in where blocks are
not contained, while non-zero values correspond to blocks and/or the game board
walls.&nbsp; The non-zero values are the colors of the blocks.
<p> Each of the 7 pieces is also represented as a
two-dimensional array, 4x4 in size, and they are collectively stored in the
Pieces variable.&nbsp; Also, the current falling piece is stored in the
CurrentPiece variable.&nbsp; For each of the 16 array cells that make up a piece
in the Pieces array, the value of the cell will either be 0, which means that
this cell is not used in constructing the piece, or 1 which means it is
used.&nbsp; So when you generate new pieces, you should copy the 0s out of the
Pieces array into the CurrentPiece array, and when you encounter a 1, you'll
need to get a random number to determine this block's color, and then you write
the value of the random number to the CurrentPiece array.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In previous MPs, your flags were separate variables, each taking up a byte in memory.
This is a waste because you only need one bit for each flag. In this MP, the
GameFlags variable will hold all of the flags you'll need to implement the game.
So, you must make sure than when you set or clear a flag that you don't alter
the values of the other flags. This will require bitwise operations such as <tt>and</tt>
and <tt>or</tt> to set, clear, or toggle only 1 bit of a byte.
<p>Only pieces that have fallen completely will be stored in the game board. Thus, the current falling piece will not appear in this array until it
stops falling and breaks apart. You will need to keep track of the X and Y position of the
current falling piece within the game board. Variables XPos and YPos will be
used to do this. XPos and YPos represent the upper left-hand corner (offset 0)
of the CurrentPiece variable. In the illustration below, the * indicates the
array cell to which XPos and YPos refer. Zero values in the CurrentPiece array
are shown as white squares.
<p><center><img src="xposypos.gif" width="192" height="192"></center>
<p>Note that the X and Y position of the current piece on the game board is
NOT the X and Y position of the current piece on the screen. The game board starts at screen coordinate (col,row) = (320,0), so you will
need to use the offset of this location when you're drawing the current piece to the video buffer.
<p>You'll have to perform collision checking between the current falling piece
and the boundaries and other pieces in the game board. To do this, you'll need to know the X and Y position of the current piece,
contained in XPos and YPos respectively, the contents of the CurrentPiece array,
and the contents of the GameBoard array. Loop through each cell in the
CurrentPiece array. If you encounter a non-zero value, you have found part of
the current piece. Then, check the corresponding cell in the GameBoard array. If
this value is also non-zero, then there is a collision between the piece and the
game board, and in this case you should move the piece back to its original
location (reset its XPos and YPos values).<p>The process of clearing blocks
requires three steps:&nbsp; first you mark the blocks that are to be cleared,
then you clear the marked blocks from the game board, and then you drop any
blocks resting on top of those blocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>In order to mark blocks, you have
to determine whether 3 or more blocks of the same color appear vertically,
horizontally, or diagonally.&nbsp; There are many ways to possibly do this, but
I recommend that you&nbsp;come up with an algorithm that is as painless as
possible.&nbsp; By adding the extra blank row at the top of the game board, I
have ensured that there is a buffer of size two around the area in which the
pieces can move.&nbsp; So, from the current block in the game board that I'm
currently processing, I can check its value, the value of its immediate neighbor
in 1 of the 8 directions, and then the value of that block's neighbor in the <b>same</b>
direction as before.&nbsp; In order to make this checking process more
efficient, the lookup table below has been created which contains the relative
offsets of neighboring blocks to the current block.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><tt>_BlockPosArray	db -16, -32,
-15, -30, 1, 2, 17, 34, 16, 32, 15, 30, -1, -2, -17, -34</tt>
<p>The numbers are stored in 8 pairs, representing each of the 8
directions.&nbsp; Within each pair, the first number is the relative offset of
the block one away from the current block, and the second number is the relative
offset of the block two away.&nbsp; Taking the first pair, -16 is the relative
offset of the block directly above the current block, and -32 is the relative
offset of the block two above the current block.&nbsp; The numbers in the array
continue around in a clockwise fashion.</p>
<p>If the values of all three blocks are the same, then mark all three
blocks.&nbsp; To do this, set the most significant bit of the byte to 1.&nbsp;
Note that when you are comparing values, you should disregard whether or not
this block has already been marked, as a marked red block is still a red block
which can possibly be used to clear a different pattern of blocks.&nbsp; Since
you're setting the MSB to 1 when marked, an equality test on the value of this
byte and a byte that hasn't been marked will come back false, even though both
are the same color.</p>
<p>Clearing blocks is simple.&nbsp; You know what blocks you have to clear and
the characteristics of these blocks.&nbsp; When you clear the blocks you don't
want anything in those spots after the clear.&nbsp; I shouldn't need to say
anything more about it.</p>
<p>All that's left is dropping the blocks.&nbsp; What you need to do is, for
each column, move every suspended block down as far as possible.&nbsp; No hints
on this one, you'll have to come up with the algorithm yourself.&nbsp; I'd
suggest drawing a picture of different test cases, and manually move blocks down
in order to see what you have to do before you start doing it.&nbsp; Jumping
into the code right away will only make you more confused when you go back to
debug it.</p>
