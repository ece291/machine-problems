<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>

  I've heard a little rumour that Engineers like to be organized--at least
  when they're working on the computer.  Outlines are one method for
  organizing our thoughts and ideas into a presentation.  The problem is
  many editors don't facilitate good habits like the proper indentation of
  outlines.  In this MP we will create a program that will read in an
  existing outline and write a properly indented one.
</p>

<h2>Problem Description</h2>

<p>
  To read through a file and decide the proper spacing of the outline, we
  will follow the following steps:
</p>
<ol type="I">
 <li> Indent the input </li>
 <ol type="A">
  <li> Decide the indentation of the line </li>
  <ol type="1">
   <li> Read one character from the input </li>
   <li> If it is a linefeed (LF)
   <ol type="a">
    <li> Ignore it by going to I.A.1 </li>
   </ol>
   <li> If it is a newline (CR) </li>
   <ol type="a">
    <li> This only occurs at a double CR </li>
    <li> Write a CR and LF to the output </li>
    <li> Exit the input stage by going to </li>
   </ol>
   <li> If it is whitespace (' ', TAB) </li>
   <ol type="a">
    <li> Ignore it by going to I.A.1 </li>
   </ol>
   <li> If it is anything else, choose the indentation by leading
   character</li>
   <ol type="a">
    <li> If it's a capital roman numeral ('I', 'V', or 'X')
    set the indentation level to 0 </li>
    <li> If it's a capital letter ('A' through 'H')
    set the indentation level to 1 </li>
    <li> If it's a Number ('0' through '9')
    set the indentation level to 2 </li>
    <li> If it's a lowercase letter ('a' through 'h')
    set the indentation level to 3 </li>
    <li> If it's a lowercase roman numeral ('i', 'v', or 'x')
    set the indentation level to 4 </li>
   </ol>
   <li> Write (2 * the indentation level) spaces to the output </li>
  </ol>
  <li> Copy the line </li>
  <ol type="1">
   <li> Read one character from the input </li>
   <li> If it is a linefeed </li>
   <ol type="a">
    <li> Ignore the linefeed by going to I.B.1 </li>
   </ol>
   <li> If it is a newline </li>
   <ol type="a">
    <li> Write CR and LF to the output </li>
    <li> Go to the next item, at I.A.1 </li>
   </ol>
   <li> If it is anything else
   <ol type="a">
    <li> Write the character to the output </li>
    <li> Next character of input: go to I.B.1 </li>
   </ol>
  </ol>
 </ol>
 <li> Summarize the outline
 <ol type="A">
  <li> Calculate statistics </li>
  <li> Display statistics </li>
 </ol>
 <li> Exit the program with MP1XIT</li>
</ol>

Note: Branches I.A and I.B look very similar. The prime difference is
what they do with Whitespace and Newlines.

<H2>Screen Dump</H2>
<P>
 The following screen capture depicts the program as it executes.  It
 prints the input it received, in indented fashion:

<H2>MP1 Program Assignment</H2>

<p>In this machine problem, the main procedure is provided for you; however,
you must write the code to replace the library routines.
You will replace these procedures from the LIBMP1
library by commenting out the statements calling the Lib routine
and adding your code.  Each routine that you write
should match the output of the library code exactly.  Each of the function calls and their functionality is described below in the
<b>Subroutines</b> section.
The best way to get a feel for the program is to run it
to see how it is supposed to operate.  You can also edit the test
file to see how various changes will affect the program execution.</p>

<p>Your program is required to:
 <ol>
  <li type="I"> Output data in the same format as the original source code
  <li> Reformat any test cases the TAs provide
  <li> Count the number of lines at each indentation level
  <li> Display the number and percentage (to the nearest integer) of each
       indentation level
  <li> Run efficiently.  Points will be deducted for inefficient algorithms
       and/or excessive coding.
 </ol>


<p>The program can be run by typing <tt>mp1</tt> at the
command prompt.  If you wish to use the test data files as input, type
<tt>mp1 &lt; test1.in</tt> at the prompt.  To output to a file and
compare the outputs type <tt>mp1 &lt; test1.in &gt; test1.mp</tt> and
then <tt>fc test1.mp test1.out</tt>
</p>

<h2>Hints</h2>
<ul>
<li>The LIBMP1 file contains executable library functions for each of the
routines that you need to implement.  
This allows you to run the program and understand how it works before you implement it.  You can test your program with any combinations of your own
code and library functions.  You will only receive credit, however, for
the routines that you implement yourself. 

<li>You may define new variables as needed.

<li>You might find it very helpful to write your own helper functions.
For instance a routine to print the value of the current line to the
screen might be helpful to use in a few routines.

<li>Be very careful to ensure that your procedure does not destroy any
of the registers it does not specify as outputs.  The calling procedure
may use them and expect them to remain unchanged.

<li>You may assume there will be no more than 200 lines at any given
indentation for any of the TA test files, and that all lines will be
shorter than 80 characters (including indentation).

<li>START EARLY!  This is the first MP that requires you to write your
own program.  Composition is much more difficult than comprehension.<p>

<li>Monitor the <a href="news:uiuc.class.ece291">newsgroup</a> for clarifications and help.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Subroutines</h2>

<p>This assignment has six procedures. You will receive credit by replacing
each of these seven procedures listed below with your own code. </p>


<table BORDER=1 >
<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td><b><font SIZE=+1>GetNextHeader</font></b></td>

<td><ul>
<li>Finds and returns the first non-LF or Whitespace character
<li>Inputs:
        <ul>
	<li>None
        </ul>
<li>Outputs:
        <ul><li>AL = first character, or -1 if first character is CR</ul>
<li>Calls: KBDIN
<li>Note: You need to save the registers you alter.&nbsp; To do this, push them
  all onto the stack in the beginning of the subroutine, and pop them all off
  the stack at the end.&nbsp; Also, document your functions with descriptive
  function headers.&nbsp; Look in your lab book for examples or ask a TA.&nbsp;
  YOU WILL LOSE POINTS IF YOU DON'T WRITE CLEAR, CONCISE FUNCTION HEADERS!!!!
 </ul></td>
</tr>


<td><b><font size="+1">GetIndent</font></b></td>

<td><ul>

<li>Returns the value for the Header's indent level
<li>keeps count of lines per that Header Level
<li>Inputs:
	<ul>
	<li> AL = Header Character</ul>
<li>Outputs:
	<ul><li> BL = Indent Level, or -1 if header character is invalid
            <li> proper entry of IndentCount is incremented</ul>

<li>Calls: none
<li>Note: Always save your registers in every procedure from here on out.  (We're not going to tell you
again!)
</ul></td>

<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td><b><font size="+1">DisplayIndent</font></b></td>

<td><ul>
       <li>Displays two spaces for every level of indent
<li>Inputs:
        <ul>
<li>Input:        BL = Indent Level
               </ul>
<li>Outputs:
        <ul><li>Indentation to output</ul>
<li>Calls: DSPOUT
</ul></td>
</tr>

<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td><b><font size="+1">DisplayItem</font></b></td>

<td><ul>
<li>Copies from input to output through (including) a CR.
<li>Inputs:
        <ul>
	<li> AL = first character of the Item
        </ul>
<li>Outputs:
        <ul>
        <li>Prints item to the output
</ul>
<li>Calls: DSPOUT, KBDIN
<li>Notes:
 <ul><li> The first character of the Item needs to be displayed.  It is
 already in AL, so start by displaying it, and not taking more
 input</li>
 </ul>
</ul></td>
</tr>

<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td><b><font size="+1">CalcTotals</font></b></td>

<td><ul>
<li>Totals the number of lines from the input, and calculates the
percentage at each header.
<li>Inputs:
        <ul>
	<li> Array IndentCount
        </ul>
<li>Outputs:
        <ul>
        <li> Updates IndentPercent, TotalLines
</ul>
<li>Calls: none
<li>Notes:
 <ul><li> To find the percentage, the formula is
 100*<i>num</i>/<i>Total</i>.  Make sure you multiply by 100 first.
 </li><li> Using MUL and DIV is tricky, and may not be covered until the
 day before this is due.  If you need help, ask a TA or someone who has
 figured them out.  Use <tt>qh MUL</tt> and <tt>qh DIV</tt> at the
 command prompt for more information.

        <li> most ____String variables
        </ul>
<li>Outputs:
        <ul>
        <li>Prints summary to output.
</ul>
<li>Calls: DSPOUT, DSPMSG, BINASC
<li>Notes:

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ul>
<li>You will begin this MP with the following files:
    <ul>
    <li><tt>MP1.ASM</tt>: Program Framework
    <li><tt>TEST*.IN</tt>: Database record file
    <li><tt>Makefile</tt>: Specifies how and when programs are assembled
        and linked.
    <li><tt>LIBMP1.LIB</tt>: Library functions for MP1
    <li><tt>LIB291.LIB</tt>: General-purpose library functions
    </ul>
<li>You may copy these files from the network drive to your home directory
    with the following command: <br>
    <tt>xcopy /s V:\ece291\mp1 W:\mp1</tt><br>
    or download the files from this server as <a href="mp1.zip">mp1.zip</a> 
<li>Add your code to <tt>MP1.ASM</tt>.
<li>Assemble and link your program by typing<br>
      <tt>nmake</tt><Br>
    This command reads <i>Makefile</i> then invokes MASM and LINK to build 
    an executable program.  
<li>Use CodeView (CV) to find and correct program errors. 
<li>Verify your program operation by testing the
    input test file.  You should alter the test file to check 
    different scenarios with your code.
</ul>

<h2>Final Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Print a copy of the MP1 grading report (<a href="mp1grade.html">MP1GR</a>).
   Double-check that your program is ready for demonstration.  You need to
   run through the test cases on the grading sheet, you WILL NOT be allowed
   to hand-in unless you have done this step.
  <li>Print MP1.ASM (Use GreenPrint32 to print at 4 pages/side.) 
  <li>Demonstrate your MP1.EXE to a TA or to the instructor. You may
   be asked to recompile and demonstrate MP1 with different input files.
   Your program must work with all given input. </li>
  <li>Be prepared to answer questions about any aspect of the operation of
   your program. The TAs will not accept an MP if you cannot fully explain
   the operation of your code and details of your implementation. Delayed
   MPs will be subject to late penalties as described in the course
   syllabus (10pts/day).</li>
  <li>The TA will copy your program to the demonstration disk.
  <li>Take your printouts to the same TA which approved your demonstration.
    Staple the grading sheet to the front of the MP1.ASM printout.  Be sure
    that your name appears in your code and on the grading sheet.
</ol>
