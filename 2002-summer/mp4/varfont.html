<p><em>For those interested in the workings of a modern font engine, be
aware that this is a simplified model.  As such you should probably see
<a href="http://freetype.sourceforge.net/freetype2/docs/glyphs/index.html">Freetype's
documentation on glyphs</a>.  The information there does not apply to
how we are using fonts in this MP.</em></p>

<h1 align="center">Fonts of Variable Width</h1>

<p>Variable width fonts are one of many things that make a graphical
interface more pleasant to use.  Instead of taking as much horizontal
space for an "i" or a "w", each character takes a width corresponding to
its shape.  Additionally, specific character combinations can be further
adjusted by a process called <a
    href="http://freetype.sourceforge.net/freetype2/docs/glyphs/glyphs-4.html#section-1">kerning</a>.
Kerning allows a "V" to come close to an "A", but sit further away from
a "Y".</p>

<h2>Corner, Left, Width, and Advance</h2>

<p>Our font image stores a bunch of consecutive letters, all squished
together.  It looks like this, if you zoom in:</p>

<img align=center src="font-a-m.png">

<p>To get to the beginning (upper-left corner) of each character, we
have to look up a pixel offset, which we call <tt>Corner</tt>.</p>

<p>Each character in one of our fonts has three more numbers describing
it and it alone.  It has a width which describes the size of the
character in our source image.  It has a left margin, which tells us how
far from the previous character's right margin we need to move.  And it
has a distance from the left margin which we should advance to get to
the right margin.<p>

<p style="clear:left">This rendering of the string
<tt>"cdefghijklm"</tt> shows what these values really mean.  Each
vertical red line represents a base position of a letter. The distance
from it to the next blue line is the left margin of a letter.  The left
margin is indicated with green arrows.  Each pair of vertical blue lines
represents a width of a letter.  The width is indicated with purple
arrows.  Each pair of red vertical lines also represents the advance for
the letter they surround.  The advance is indicated with light-blue
arrows.</p>

<p>Note that the left margins of <tt>'f'</tt> and <tt>'g'</tt> are zero,
(light green arrows) and <tt>'j'</tt> is negative (orange arrows).  This
does indicate no movement, and leftwards movement, respectively.
Further note that in all cases, the advance value is applied from the
base position (red lines), even in the case of <tt>'j'</tt> and its
negative left margin.</p>

<p>Width tells you the size of the rectangle to copy from the source
image but Advance tells you how big the rectangle it takes in the
destination image.  For example, <tt>'l'</tt> has a width of 2 pixels,
which allows you to pull the <tt>'l'</tt> out but not grab the
<tt>'k'</tt> or the <tt>'m'</tt>.  Then its Advance of 4 pixels gives it
some breathing room.</p>

<p>The Width of <tt>'f'</tt> is greater than its Advance, and thus the
rectangles for <tt>'f'</tt> and <tt>'g'</tt> overlap (<tt>'g'</tt> has a
Left of 0).  This has the opposite effect, effectively taking away some
room on the right side of the <tt>'f'</tt>.  None of these special cases
listed here require special casing in the code.  Instead they make good
cases to check to verify a properly working implementation.</p>

<p>All this information is stored in the font data file, discussed below</p>

<h2>Kerning</h2>

<p>Kerning is a method of fine-tuning character positions.  While the
above use of Left, Width, and Advance will allow you to draw a perfectly
usable string, there are often cases where considerable improvement is
possible.  Within a given letter's Width-wide rectangle, there is often
unused space.  For example, the upper-left and upper-right corners of an
<tt>'A'</tt>, the lower-left and lower-right corners of a <tt>'V'</tt>
or a <tt>'T'</tt>, or the upper area of most lowercase characters.</p>

<p>When corresponding unused space exists in adjacent letters, the
second letter can be brought in towards the first.  The characters
<tt>"AV"</tt> can be drawn closer together than the characters
<tt>"AA"</tt> in many fonts.  In this case the entry for <tt>"AV"</tt>
might hold a value like <tt>-2</tt>, and when drawing a <tt>'V'</tt>
after an <tt>'A'</tt>, this <tt>-2</tt> should be added to the starting
location for <tt>'V'</tt>.  Unlike the Left-margin, this moves the
entire character and all subsequent characters over.</p>

<p>Since this information is also font-specific, it is also stored in
the font data file.</p>

<h2>Anti-aliasing</h2>

<p>Now that characters are being positioned as ideally as possible,
there is one last thing to address: sub-pixel outlines.  The above
images have a lot of grey pixels.  At such a large size, they look ugly,
but at their original size, they help maintain the readibility of each
letter.</p>

<p>This information is stored in the alpha channel of the font image.
When the alpha channel is 255, the pixel is at full intensity.  When
it's 0, the pixel is transparent, and the original destination pixel
should be used.  When it's anywhere inbetween, the color is linearly
interpolated between the full intensity pixel of our desired font color
and the original destination pixel, just like alpha compositing.</p>

<p>The trick here is to run an alpha composition of the font's alpha
channel and the desired RGB for this character or string, with the
destination pixel's RGB (destination alpha is always ignored).</p>

<h2>Font Data</h2>

<p>The information necessary to implement all the above kerning is
stored in a companion file.  For this MP the files <tt>arialbd.png</tt>
and <tt>arialbd.dat</tt> hold the font image, and font data
respectively.  The image is a horizontal juxtaposition of all
characters, like the subset above.  The data file has three
sections:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Width and Height of corresponding font imagefile; both are
    dwords,</li>
    <li>256 position values, where each position value has structure:
    <ul>
	<li>xpos    resd 1  ; pixel offset of upper-left corner of
	letter</li>
	<li>left    resb 1  ; left margin in pixels</li>
	<li>width   resb 1  ; width of source character in pixels</li>
	<li>advance resb 1  ; width of destination in pixels</li>
	<li>dummy   resb 1  ; pads out to 8 bytes per letter</li>
    </ul>
    and are thus addressed as <tt>[[_FDatOff]+8+character*8]</tt></li>
    <li>256*256 kerning values, where each value is a byte representing
    kerning width for the corresponding character pair.  They are
    addressed as
    <tt>[[_FDatOff]+8+256*8+<em>prev_char</em>*256+<em>cur_char</em>]</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>The image itself is a series of dwords, each holding an RGBA value
(R[ed] in the lowest byte, A[lpha] in the highest byte), organized with
consecutive rows following eachother like the graphics screen is
organized.  The equation
Offset=<tt>[_FontOff]</tt>+(Row*Width+Column)*DataSize will be used
often.</p>

<p>The above position values are all signed, and assume that the font
data file has been loaded into memory at offset <tt>[_FDatOff]</tt>, and
the font image file has been loaded at offset <tt>[_FontOff]</tt>.</p>
