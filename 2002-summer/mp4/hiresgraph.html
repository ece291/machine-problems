<h1>High Resolution Graphics Library</h1>
<p>You've tackled text mode video, and now it's time to move on to bigger and
better things.&nbsp; Enter high resolution graphics.</p>
<h2>How to Interface</h2>
<p>The interface to the High Resolution Graphics Library is fairly simple:</p>
<ul>
  <li>invoke _InitGraphics, dword _kbINT, dword _kbIRQ, dword _kbPort
  <li>invoke _FindGraphicsMode, word x-res, word y-res, word bits-per-pixel,
    dword allow-emulated
  <li>mov [mode], ax
  <li>invoke _SetGraphicsMode, word [mode]
  <li>Allocate image buffer with same bits-per-pixel as selected mode
  <li>Write to image buffer
  <li>invoke _CopyToScreen to copy the image buffer or portion thereof to the
    screen
  <li>call UnsetGraphicsMode
  <li>call ExitGraphics
  <li>exit</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a few notes about the library:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Each pixel in a 32-bit mode is RGBA from low byte to high byte, and takes
    4 bytes to describe (in a 24-bit mode it's RGB and takes 3 bytes)
  <li>If you allocate a 32-bit image buffer the size of the screen, it will
    be xres*yres*4 bytes long. Remember the *4 on the end. Remember it when you
    go to the next row, and remember it when you advance a pixel.  It's
    important.
  <li>Unlike the Text Video Mode, this is double buffered, and you cannot write
    directly to the screen. Call _CopyToScreen if you want to see any results.
    Feel free to put in more calls to this when debugging, but remember to
    remove it (for speed, etc.) once you're done.
</ol>
The one non-graphics thing you have to be aware of is that we've moved the
keyboard.  It's dynamically assigned, with the proper settings returned by
InitGraphics into the parameters passed it (in the above example, after the
InitGraphics call, _kbINT (a byte-sized variable) will hold the interrupt
number, _kbIRQ (a byte) will hold the IRQ, and _kbPort (a word) will hold the
port.  You don't have to ACK the keyboard (like you may have done in MP3), but
you do have to ack with the PIC with <tt>mov al, 20h </tt>and<tt> out 20h,
al</tt>.  In addition, if the IRQ is above 7, it's necessary to ack the slave
PIC with <tt>mov al, 20h </tt>and<tt> out 0A0h, al</tt>.  The moveable keyboard
lets us use the debugger, and solves some other problems, so it's worth the
irregularity.
<h2>How to make use of it</h2>
<p>This library is rather complicated in function to give you an interface as
similar as possible to what assembly has always used. Due to the way it
functions, however, you do get some perks.&nbsp; What you have to do to use it is the following:</p>
<p>In any DOS window you wish to run your assembly graphics program, run ex291.
ex291 reads the environment variable EX291 to determine the keyboard and mouse
settings, as well as determine whether the program will be run in full-screen
mode or windowed mode.  Full-screen mode is what we will require for handins.
Windowed mode allows you to debug - you'll get both the graphics window and the
debug window.</p>
<p>If you want to switch from one mode to another, or for any reason wish to
remove the driver, simply run it again, and it will uninstall. It will tell you
if it successfully installed or uninstalled, so you will know its status.</p>
<p>If something goes horribly wrong, press CTRL-ALT-DEL and choose the task
manager. Tell the ECE 291 Display Driver to exit (forcibly if necessary). You
will need to restart the graphics driver (not the machine) if this happens.</p>
<h3>The EX291 Environment Variable</h3>
<p>The EX291 environment variable, like the BLASTER environment variable used by
old SoundBlasters, contains several different options that can be used to set
what resources EX291 uses and on what ports.  Seperate multiple options with
spaces.  The environment variable must be set _before_ running ex291.com!</p>
<p><ul>
  <li>w|S<p>w=windowed/S=fullscreen.  Selects whether EX291 will fullscreen the
    application window when switching into graphics mode.  Fullscreen is
    faster, windowed allows for debugging in the Command Prompt window.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Kx,yyy
    <p>x=IRQ virtual keyboard uses, yyy=I/O port virtual keyboard uses (in hex).
      The virtual keyboard is used when a key is pressed when the graphics
      window has focus (or when EX291 is running fullscreen).  It acts
      identically to the normal keyboard, only it uses a different IRQ and I/O
      port to allow for debugging.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Mz
    <p>z=IRQ virtual mouse uses.  In graphics mode, EX291 overrides the normal
      mouse driver with its own internal functions.  To do this, it needs an
      IRQ to use internally.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Select IRQs and I/O ports for these options which the application doesn't
need for other purposes and the hardware hasn't already taken (eg, don't try
to put the virtual keyboard on IRQ1: it will conflict with the hardware IRQ
port and cause unpredictable behavior).</p>
<p>Examples:<br>
  <tt>EX291=w K7,300 M12</tt> - windowed, keyboard on IRQ7, port 300h, mouse on
    IRQ12<br>
  <tt>EX291=S K10,301 M5</tt> - full screen, keyboard on IRQ10 (high IRQ!),
    port 301h, mouse on IRQ5</p>
<h3>The VBEAF_PATH Environment Variable</h3>
<p>This environment variable allows you to run EX291 from any directory on your
machine.&nbsp; Its should be set to EX291's bin subdirectory.&nbsp; So, if you
are working at home and you place EX291 in the c:\ece291\ex291 directory on your
computer, you should set VBEAF_PATH=c:\ece291\ex291\bin.</p>
<!--<h2>Known Problems</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, as is often the case with the first round of any software,
there are some problems with the library. So here are some of the things that
we'ver heard cause problems, so you can <em>avoid</em> them. Or at least, you
can know that we know it may crash when you do them. Or something.
<ol>
  <li>When debugging in windowed mode, only switch between the debug window and the Graphics window. Switching to any other window will sometimes
    completely freeze your program.</li>
</ol>
