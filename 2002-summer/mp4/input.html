<h1>Handling User Input</h1>
<p>You can control a protected mode program with both the keyboard and
the mouse.  Graphical 291Hack doesn't have any use for the mouse, but
you may find the information about it useful for your final project.</p>

<h2>Keyboard</h2>
<p>After MP3, keyboard ISRs should be no problem for you now.  In
the _KeyboardISR, you will need to update the [Input] variable again by
the scancode you read from the key the user pressed.  Refer to the <a
    href="hiresgraph.html">basics of graphics programming</a> and the
various <a href="pmode.html">protected mode programming</a> resources
for more information on what's different here from MP3.</p>

<h2><a name="mouse">Mouse</a></h2>
<p>Like the keyboard, you would need procedures for installation,
removal, and handling the mouse data.</p>

<p><strong>But!</strong></p>

<p>The mouse handler isn't truly a handler at all. It's a callback. A
callback is the best of both worlds: it gets called like a normal
procedure, getting all data in standard places instead of having to
perform odd I/O to get it; yet it is also called in interrupt fashion -
only, and immediately, when data is available.</p>

<p>Or to look at it slightly less positive way, it's still called from
an interrupt, so you have to be careful about what you call -
particularly no DOS interrupts.</p>

<p>Luckily for you, the library does have a function available that gets
a real-mode callback address for your protected mode callback: Get_RMCB.
However, you will still need to tell the mouse driver to call the
callback, and where the callback is.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use Get_RMCB to get a real-mode callback address for
  MouseCallback. Save the segment and offset in MouseSeg and
  MouseOff</li>
  <li>Call the Mouse interrupt (33h), function 0Ch to have the mouse
  driver call your callback on left mouse button press and release and
  mouse movement</li>
</ul>

<p>Removing the mouse callback is a matter of reversing your steps.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Again use the mouse interrupt, this time to tell the mouse not to
  call your callback - use segment:offset of 0000:0000 for &quot;no
  callback&quot;</li>
  <li>Then, use Free_RMCB to release the real-mode callback</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that you've got the callback installing and removing, what does
your actual callback have to do?&nbsp; When the user clicks the mouse,
just update the _MPFlags variable accordingly.&nbsp; Also update the
position of the mouse, which is stored in the _MouseX and _MouseY
variables. </p>
