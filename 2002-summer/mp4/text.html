<h1>Drawing Anti-aliased Text in High Resolution Graphics</h1>
<p>Now that you know how the library works, it's time to start using it.</p>
<h2>Blitting</h2>
<p>Blitting is conceptually easy. You make a copy of an image (or part of an
image) in another place. You do it really fast. This is what allows you to draw
a mouse cursor, or characters of a font, or just about anything you see in a
graphical user environment.&nbsp; There's a caveat to a general blitting
function: the widths of the source and destination images aren't usually the
same.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's see an example with drawing a letter on the screen, as
this is what you'll be doing in this MP.&nbsp; Here's the image of a section of
the font file, with the 'A' being the character we will draw to the screen.&nbsp;
The entire font file has 128 characters, and each character is 16 pixels wide
and 16 pixels high.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="font-a.png" width="185" height="50"></p>
<p>Once we find the offset corresponding to the upper-left pixel of the source
character and the offset for the upper-left pixel of the destination, we'll be
good to go.&nbsp; A character's initial offset in the font image is dependent on
its ASCII value, the size of the character, and the number of bytes needed for
each pixel.&nbsp; Take the letter 'A' in this example. Its offset in the font
image is 4160 decimal, and here's how to get that number:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The ASCII value of 'A' is 65 decimal</li>
  <li>Each letter in the font image is 16 pixels wide</li>
  <li>Each pixel takes up 4 bytes in memory</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, 65 * 16 pixels * 4 bytes / pixel = 4160 bytes.&nbsp; You'll also need
to calculate the initial offset of the destination (x,y) pixel.&nbsp; For that
you'll need the width of the destination, the (x,y) values, and the number of
bytes per pixel.&nbsp; It's up to you to come up with the formula on this one.</p>
<p>Now all you need to know is how many rows and columns to copy, and this will
vary with each image (in our example they're both 16).&nbsp; For each of the <i>NumRows</i>
rows, you'll copy <i>NumColumns</i> pixels out of the source image and place
them in the destination image, moving right after each one.&nbsp; When you draw <i>NumColumns</i>
pixels in the current row of the source image, you'll have to move down to the
next row in both the source and destination images, keeping in mind that you'll
also have to return to the original columns in both images.&nbsp; Again, you'll
need the widths (in <b>bytes</b> - remember 4 bytes per pixel!) of the source
and destination images to move down to the next row properly.&nbsp; Do this for
each character in your string, and voilà, you have a string of text on the
screen.</p>
<h2>Anti-aliasing Through Alpha Blending</h2>
<p>There are two parts to the idea of alpha blending - the alpha part and the
blending part (ingenious I know).&nbsp; First we'll cover alpha opacity, then
we'll learn how to use this to combine images on the screen.</p>
<h3>Alpha Opacity</h3>
<p>A lot of people think of transparency when they hear the word
&quot;alpha&quot; in the context of graphics. They're right, sort of. Al<img alt="Figure A: Outlined Coverage of a Triangle on a pixel grid" src="triangle.png" align="right" width="360" height="270">pha
really refers to the opacity of a pixel, which is derived generally from the
coverage of a pixel.</p>
<p align="left">What is meant by the coverage of a pixel? Let's say you're
drawing a triangle. The bottom and the left of the triangle are horizontal and
vertical, respectively. The remaining side is at 45°. Now fill this triangle
with a blue color. Now draw it to the screen. The outline, zoomed in, is shown
in Figure A.</p>
<p align="left">Where are the 45° pixels? For that matter, if all these lines
go through the centers of pixels, chances are the left and bottom and
upper-right include a lot of half-covered pixels; the lower-left corner has a
one-quarter covered pixel and the two remaining corners have about a one-eighth
covered pixel, as visualized in Figure A.<br>
</p>
<h3 align="left"><b>The Over Operation</b></h3>
<p>So how do you turn this into actual pixels? The simplest way, and the way
we're using, is called the over operation. To draw color A with coverage &#945;
over color B, the resulting color C is calculated as follows:</p>
<p>C<sub>r</sub> = (&#945;<sub>r</sub> * A<sub>r</sub>) + ((1-&#945;<sub>r</sub>)
* B<sub>r</sub>)<br>
C<sub>g</sub> = (&#945;<sub>g</sub> * A<sub>g</sub>) + ((1-&#945;<sub>g</sub>) *
B<sub>g</sub>)<br>
C<sub>b</sub> = (&#945;<sub>b</sub> * A<sub>b</sub>) + ((1-&#945;<sub>b</sub>) *
B<sub>b</sub>)</p>
<p>Or more succinctly, as we only have one &#945;, apply this to each channel
independently:<img alt="Figure B: Triangle Drawn with Over Compositions, alpha by coverage" src="triangle-over.png" align="right" width="360" height="270">
<p align="left">C = (&#945; * A) + ((1-&#945;) * B)<br>
C = (&#945; * A) + B - &#945; * B</p>
<p>When we apply this to the case as listed above, with coverage values one,
one-half, one-quarter, and one-eighth, we get something that looks like Figure
B, only not quite so zoomed in, and no grid.<br>
<br>
Things like this are where alpha opacity values originally come from. Don't
worry about how to calculate the alpha value, as the font image comes with an
alpha value for you. Concentrate on how to apply it using the over operator.</p>
<p>Here's how the value for the lower-left corner pixel was calculated, assuming
a white background (B) upon which you draw a pure blue pixel with 25% coverage:</p>
<div class="eqn">
  C = (&#945; * A) + ((1-&#945;) * B)<br>
  C = (0.25 * {0.0, 0.0, 1.0}) + (0.75 * {1.0, 1.0, 1.0})<br>
  C = {0.0, 0.0, 0.25} + {0.75, 0.75, 0.75}<br>
  C = {0.75, 0.75, 1.0}
</div>
<p>Notice that the pixels in the font file are all black, with some of them
being darker than others.&nbsp; The lighter pixels have alpha values closer to
zero that distinguish them as such (<tt>0h</tt> is no coverage, while <tt>FFh</tt>
is total coverage).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wait... all the pixels are black?&nbsp; How will we be able to see the
characters on a black background? Can we get text of different color? Yes you
can.&nbsp; To do this, the easiest way is to set them manually by OR'ing the
pixel's RGB portion with a hex color value, making sure not to change the alpha
portion.&nbsp; So if you OR'ed a pixel with <tt>007F7F7Fh</tt>, you'd set its
color to gray.</p>
<p>In this MP, we will make an assumption that will simplify things for
us.&nbsp; This assumption will be that we will always be drawing on a black
background.&nbsp; Notice what this does to the equation for the over operation:</p>
<p>C = (&#945; * A) + ((1-&#945;) * B)<br>
C = (&#945; * A) + ((1-&#945;) * {0.0 0.0 0.0})<br>
C = (&#945; * A) + {0.0 0.0 0.0}<br>
C = (&#945; * A)</p>
<p>We now introduce an optimized algorithm that uses MMX instructions to alpha
compose all four channels of a pixel at once:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Load one source pixel (4 bytes) into an MMX register (8 bytes) - yes this
    can be done, take a look at the MMX manual
  <li>Unpack (bytes to words) the source pixel into an MMX register
  <li>Copy out the source alpha word into all four words of another MMX register
  <li>Multiply the two previously mentioned MMX registers together, as this will
    perform C = (&#945; * A)
  <li>Shift each word right to divide by 256, thus fitting into a byte per
    channel
  <li>Pack (words to bytes) the alpha-composed pixel back together with proper
    saturation
  <li>Store the pixel into a general purpose register from the MMX register -
    again this can be done</li>
</ul>
