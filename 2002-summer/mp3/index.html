<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Despite being designed primarily to make tedious calculations faster
to perform, computers have long been used for entertainment.  Computers
have often taken the place of dice in role-playing games, and even used
random routines to create a world.</p>

<p>A well known game by the name of nethack (<a
    href="http://www.arcfan.demon.co.uk/acorn/hack.htm">screenshots</a>)
allows the player to explore a dungeon, collect and use items, and fight
evil creatures.  Our 291hack will be lightly modeled after this classic.</p>

<h2>Problem Description</h2>

<img align=center class=noprint src=mp3.png width=645 height=606>

<p>291hack will avoid many tedious-to-code features of nethack, instead
focusing on exploration and item collection.  Exploration in turn
requires a world, visibility modeling, character motion, and user input.
Item collection requires a list of items, as well as user input.</p>

<h3>A World</h3>

<p>Our world is a collection of tiles, each to be displayed as a single
character in text mode video.  Each tile has several attributes
associated with it: it can be a wall, a hallway, a door, etc.
Furthermore it can be solid (blocks travel and sight).  But also we will
need to track visibility.</p>

<p>The world is then stored as an array of this information
(<tt>Map</tt>), allowing us to iterate over all locations and draw them
as required.  We will use one level of indirection here to allow easy
customization of the game: rather than store the appearance of each tile
in the map, we will store an index into an array <tt>MapTiles</tt>.
<tt>MapTiles</tt> is a lookup table 16 word-sized entries long with
screen character in the low byte and (background) attribute in the high
byte.</p>

<h3>Visibility</h3>

<p>To efficiently track visibility, each tile will have two more
attributes: <em>visible</em> (can the character see this tile now?) and
<em>seen</em> (has the character ever seen this tile?).  Updating these
values is conceptually simple, but algorithmically more difficult.
Conceptually, we wish to add the <em>seen</em> attribute whenever we add
the <em>visible</em> attribute, and never remove it.  We only want
to add the <em>visible</em> attribute when a tile is both close enough
to be seen, and our sight is not blocked by a closer tile.  We want to
delete the <em>visible</em> attribute whenever a tile is no longer in
range, or becomes blocked due to our motion.</p>

<table border>
    <tr>
	<td width="12%"><em>visible</em></td>
	<td width="12%"><em>seen</em></td>
	<td width="12%"><em>solid</em></td>
	<td width="12%">(unused)</td>
	<td width="12%">bit 3</td>
	<td width="12%">bit 2</td>
	<td width="12%">bit 1</td>
	<td width="12%">bit 0</td>
    </tr>
    <caption>Information for each tile (byte) in <tt>Map</tt></caption>
</table>

<p>The method we will use to determine visibility is shadow casting.  If you
examine <tt>shadow.asm</tt>, you will find a series of lookup tables.  These
correspond to the 6x6 quadrant with your character in the upper-left corner,
and objects in single locations for the upper-left 5x5 locations.</p>

<p>Always use the first shadow map, as this blocks off the edge of the
roughly-circular radius.  Then subsequently logically or in the shadow maps
for any locations that have a blocking tile.  A final 6x6 square has been
allocated by the name <tt>ShadowWork</tt>, where it is suggested you combine
these shadows.</p>

<p>Once you have combined all the relevant shadow masks, you can test each
tile in <tt>ShadowWork</tt> for visibility blocking.  Tiles with a value of
<tt>1Fh</tt> are the only ones that should be considered blocked; all others
are either <tt>00h</tt> (clear sight) or somewhere inbetween (partial
coverage, modeled as unblocked).  Set the corresponding tiles in Map to
<em>visible</em>.</p>

<p>Note that this the shadow maps are only for the +x, +y quadrant, and must
be flipped or rotated to allow you to determine the other quadrants.  It's
suggested that you do this by changing your loop increments, not the actual
shadow data.</p>

<h3>Character Motion</h3>

<p>Our character can move in any of 8 directions, corresponding to the
keys on the number-pad.  Each key specifies one of the directions, and
the character will move one tile for each time it is pressed.  After the
character moves, visibility needs to be updated, and the screen
redrawn.</p>

<table border>
    <tr><td width="33%">Home (Up-Left)</td><td width="33%">Up</td><td width="33%">Page Up (Up-Right)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Left</td><td></td><td>Right</td></tr>
    <tr><td>End (Down-Left)</td><td>Down</td><td>Page Down (Down-Right)</td></tr>
    <caption>Direction Keys</caption>
</table>

<p>Note that the character's current location is stored with the same
(x, y) information as items are: the low byte holds an x coordinate, and
the high byte holds a y coordinate.</p>

<h3>Item Lists</h3>

<p>We need to track the location of several items.  Each item will
either be located on the map tile at some (x, y), or the character has
picked it up and is carrying the item in his pocket.  This will be
represented by an <tt>Items</tt> array with (x,y), itemtype, and
<em>pocketed</em>.  Once an item is in the character's pocket, it must
be selectable by a letter ('a' through 'z').</p>

<p>The character is lazy, and wants to use the lowest letters possible
at all times, but is too lazy to resort his items to pack them better.
We represent this with a <tt>Pocket</tt> array, with intially all empty
spots.  To pick up an item, find the first <em>empty</em>
<tt>Pocket</tt>.  Set this <tt>Pocket</tt> to point to the
<tt>Item</tt>, by storing the index of the <tt>Item</tt> there.<p>

<p>As an example, the <tt>Pocket</tt> array would look like this after
picking up <tt>Item</tt> indices: 3, 4, 5, 1, 2; dropping
<tt>Pocket</tt> indices: 1, 3; and picking up item 9:</p>

<table border>
    <caption><tt>Pocket</tt></caption>
    <tr><td><strike>E</strike> 3</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strike>E</strike> <strike>4</strike> <strike>E</strike> 9</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strike>E</strike> 5</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strike>E</strike> <strike>1</strike> E</td></tr>
    <tr><td><strike>E</strike> 2</td></tr>
    <tr><td>E</td></tr>
    <tr><td>...</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>User Input</h3>

<p>We will be gathering input from an interrupt handler.  While the only
benefit this gives us now is an easier way to handle the arrow keys,
if we were to extend this into a multiplayer game it would allow us to
easily handle updates when the local player is not moving.</p>

<p>The interrupt handler <tt>KeyboardISR</tt> should set <tt>Input</tt>
to a scancode which <tt>MP3Main</tt> maps to one of five types of
things.  Check the <a href="../../books/labmanual/">lab manual</a> for
more information on scancodes, as well as a skeleton ISR.</p>

<ul>
    <li><tt>ESC</tt> if the escape key is pressed, to quit</li>
    <li><tt>'a' through 'z'</tt> if a letter is pressed, to drop an item</li>
    <li><tt>' '</tt> if the spacebar is pressed, to pick up an item</li>
    <li><tt>INPUT_*</tt>, a directional constant, to indicate motion</li>
    <li>Everything else, which is ignored</li>
</ul>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>For this program you will write nine modular procedures:</p>

<table border>
<tr><th>MP3Main</th><td>
<ul>
    <li>Waits for and handles user input</li>
  <li>Inputs:
  <ul><li>None</li></ul></li>

  <li>Pseudocode Loop Iteration:
  <ul>
      <li>Clear Input to zero</li>
      <li>Wait for nonzero Input</li>
      <li>Clear status display</li>
      <li>if Input maps to <tt>'a'</tt> through <tt>'z'</tt>
      <ul><li>DropItem(Input - 'a')</li></ul></li>
      <li>else if Input maps to <tt>' '</tt>
      <ul><li>PickUp()</li></ul></li>

      </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Notes:
  <ul>
      <li>Call MoveChar() and DrawMap() to set up and draw the
      screen the first time</li>

<H2>Hints</H2>
<ul>

  <li>The libmp3 file contains executable library functions 
  for each of the routines that you need to implement. This allows you to run 
  the program and understand how it works before you implement it. You can test 
  your program by stepping through&nbsp;it and making sure the display and 
  comparison functions work correctly. You will only receive credit, however, 
  for the routines that you implement yourself. </li>

  <li>When debugging your code in Turbo Debugger, you will 
  find it helpful to use the memory window to show you the memory location of 
  the file and strings. You can also use the watch window to keep track of 
  variables in your code. </li>

  <li>Run the program many times to get a good feel of 
  it.&nbsp; Your final program with your code should resemble our version.&nbsp; 
  Formatting aesthetics aren't as important as correctly operating code. </li>

  <li>Do not forget to push and pop to avoid clobbering 
  registers! </li>

  <li>Push and Pop can also be used on memory, as long as 
  you specify the size and it's word-sized or larger. You don't have to move it 
  into a register first. (Yes, this does appear to break the two-memory access 
  rule. Don't worry!) </li>

  <li>Remember to include function headers for&nbsp;and 
  write comments in each of your functions!&nbsp; Headers should give a general 
  idea of what the function does and have a list of inputs, outputs, and called 
  functions.&nbsp; Commenting should be specific enough to allow a function to 
  be understood by just reading the comments.&nbsp; Commenting every line, 
  however, is excessive and may cost you some points. </li>

  <li>START EARLY! </li>

  <li>Monitor the <A href="news:uiuc.class.ece291">newsgroup</a> for
clarifications and help.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You will begin this MP with the following files:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>MP3.ASM</tt>: Program Framework
    <li><tt>Makefile</tt>: Specifies how and when programs are assembled and
    linked.
    <li><tt>libmp3.lib</tt>: Library functions for MP3
    <li><tt>lib291.lib</tt>: General-purpose library functions </li></ul>
  <li>You may copy these files from the network drive to your home directory
  with the following command: <br><tt>xcopy /s V:\ece291\mp3 W:\mp3</tt><br>or
  download the files from this server as <A href="mp3.zip">mp3.zip</A>
  <li>Add your code to <tt>MP3.ASM</tt>.
  <li>Assemble and link your program by typing<br><tt>make</tt><br>This command
  reads <em>Makefile</em> then invokes NASM and LINK to build an executable
  program.
  <li>Use Turbo Debugger (TD) to find and correct program errors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Steps</h2>
<ol>

  <li>Demonstrate your MP3.EXE to a TA. You may be asked to 
  recompile and demo the program. Your program must work with all given input.</li>

  <li>Be prepared to answer questions about any aspect of the operation
  of your program. The TAs will not accept an MP if you cannot fully
  explain the operation of your code and the details of your
  implementation. Delayed MPs will be subject to late penalties as
  described in the course syllabus (15pts/day).</li>

  <li>The TA will handin your MP online.</li>

</ol>
