<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Calculators were one of the greatest gifts to the engineer last century.
They eliminated the tedious work of calculating numeric results.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) innovated a method of calculation called Reverse Polish
Notation (RPN).</p>

<p>RPN employs a stack to hold numbers and intermediate results.  When a
number is entered, it is PUSHed to the stack.  When an operation is entered,
it POPs its operand(s) from the stack, performs the calculation, and PUSHes
the result back to the stack.  With RPN there is no need for parentheses or
equal buttons.</p>

<p>Using RPN, the equation <em>X+(Y*Z)</em> can be computed by entering the
following keystrokes:</p>

<div style="border: #AAA 3px ridge; text-align:center;"><tt>X [enter] Y [enter] Z [enter] * [enter] + [enter]</tt></div>

<p>For this example, X, Y, and Z were pushed to the stack.  When the
multiplication command was entered (*), the values Y and Z were POPped from
the stack.  Y*Z was computed, and this product (YZ) was PUSHed back to the
stack.  When the addition command was entered (+), X and YZ were POPped from
the stack, X+YZ was computed, and this sum was pushed back to the stack.
The final result is stored at the top of the stack.</p>

<h2>Problem Description</h2>

<p>For this machine problem, you will implement the core functionality of a
RPN calculator.  Your calculator will compute results on 32-bit rational
numbers composed of a 16-bit integer numerator and 16-bit integer
denominator.  It will print results in split fractional form (3 + 4/5) or
improper fractional form (19/5).  It will support all standard logical and
mathematical operations.  Fractions will always be reported in lowest
terms.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Internal Storage</strong></li>
  <p>All numbers are internally stored as a pair of 16-bit signed integers
using 2's complement notation.  16-bit words are PUSHed and POPped to and
from a custom stack (<tt>OperandStack</tt>) at its top (<tt>StackTop</tt>).
For this machine problem, you may choose whether you wish to detect stack
overflows and underflows, or you may assume they do not occur (our tests
will never POP more numbers than were already PUSHed).</p>

  <p>Note that our <tt>OperandStack</tt> closely mimics the real stack, and
that <tt>word [[StackTop]]</tt> refers to the numerator of the top value, and
<tt>word [[StackTop]+2]</tt> refers to the denominator of the top value.  But
in a fit of genious, <tt>OperandStack</tt> is designed to confuse your
understanding of the real stack, by growing forward in memory.  The second
top-most item is at <tt>word [[StackTop]-4]</tt> and <tt>word
[[StackTop]-2]</tt>.  When you PUSH an operand, the operand you add should go
to <tt>word [[StackTop]+4]</tt> and <tt>word [[StackTop]+6]</tt>.</p>

  <li><strong>DispImproper</strong></li>
  <p>The variable <tt>DispImproper</tt> determines how you numbers should be
displayed.  If it stores the value 0, a fraction should be seperated into
an integer component, and a fraction less than 1.  The fraction
<tt>11/3</tt> should be displayed as <tt>3 2/3</tt> in this mode.

  <p>If <tt>DispImproper</tt> is non-zero, fractions should be displayed in
their simplest, improper, form.  The fraction <tt>11/3</tt> should be
displayed as <tt>11/3</tt> in this mode.</p>

  <p>The display mode can be changed by entering the commands MI or MS (mode
improper, or mode split).  By default, the calculator should operate in
split mode.</p>

  <p>Note that unnecessary components should be left out.  If the fraction
is 32/1, only <tt>32</tt> should be displayed.  If it's 1/3, only
<tt>1/3</tt> should be displayed regardless of <tt>DispImproper</tt> (<tt>0
1/3</tt> won't ever be displayed.)</p>

  <li><strong>Operations</strong></li>
  <p>Operations may take either one or two operands from the stack, perform
an operation, and push the result back to the stack.  Let S0 refer to the
element at the top of the stack, and S1 refer to the next element.</p>

  <p>Single-operand instructions (such as negation) POP the first element
from the stack (S0), perform the operation, then PUSH the result back to the
stack to become the new S0.  Two-operand instructions (such as addition) POP
the first two elements (S0 and S1), perform the operation, then PUSH teh
result back to the stack to become the new S0.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>For this program you will write five modular procedures:</p>

<table border>
<tr><th>GetInput</th><td>
<ul>
  <li>Reads a line of input from the user, handles backspace, ignores LF, and
  exits on ESC or Enter.</li>
  <li>Inputs:</li>
  <ul> <li>constant <tt>MAXBUFLEN</tt></li> </ul>
  <li>Outputs:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><tt>al</tt> = last entered key</li>
    <li>variable <tt>InputBuffer</tt> = string input by user</li>
    <li>variable <tt>BufLength</tt> = number of characters put into <tt>InputBuffer</tt></li>
  </ul>
</ul>
</td></tr>

<tr><th>ProcessInput</th><td>
<ul>
<li>Decides what to do based on user entry.  PUSHes (number)/1 if a number is
entered, or returns the Command.  Optionally disallows PUSHing if
<tt>OperandStack</tt> is full</li>
<li>Inputs:</li>
<ul>
 <li>variable <tt>InputBuffer</tt> = string input by user</li>
 <li>variable <tt>BufLength</tt> = number of valid characters in <tt>InputBuffer</tt></li>
 <li>constant <tt>STACKDEPTH</tt> = number of bytes in <tt>OperandStack</tt></li>
</ul>
<li>Outputs: </li>
<ul>
  <li><tt>bh</tt> = 1 if a number, 0 if empty, or command character ('+', 'N', etc)</li>
  <li>variable <tt>StackTop</tt> updated if a number is PUSHed</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</td></tr>

<tr><th>Calculate</th><td>
<ul>
 <li>Do nothing if command code is 0 or 1, or execute the command</li>
<li>Inputs:</li>
<ul><li><tt>bh</tt> = command character or code</li></ul>
<li>Outputs:</li>
<ul><li>variable <tt>StackTop</tt> = updated if a 2 operand command executes</li></ul>
<li>Notes:</li>
<ul>
<li>You will not be tested on operations that result in negative numbers.</li>
<li>Storing your rational number in lowest terms is suggested.</li>
</ul>
 </ul>
</td></tr>

<tr><th>int GCD(m, n)</th><td>
<ul>
    <li>Return the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of its two
    arguments</li>
<li>Inputs:</li>
<ul><li>two 16-bit numbers passed C-style on the stack</li></ul>
<li>Outputs:</li>
<ul><li>16-bit value GCD of inputs</li></ul>
<li>Notes:</li>
<ul><li>Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the GCD recursively:</li>
    <table>
	<tr><th rowspan="3">GCD(m,n) =</th><td rowspan="3"><span style="font-size:300%;">{</span></td><td>m</td><td>if m=n</td></tr>
    <tr><td>GCD(m-n,n)</td><td>if m > n</td></tr>
    <tr><td>GCD(m,n-m)</td><td>if m < n</td></tr></table>
<li>Watch out for the case 0/1; the above GCD won't terminate</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</td></tr>

<tr><th>PrintRational</th><td>
<ul>
<li>Print out the rational number at the top of the OperandStack</li>
<li>Inputs:</li>
<ul><li>variable <tt>DispImproper</tt> = zero to display simplified,
    nonzero for improper fraction</li>
    <li>variable <tt>StackTop</tt> = address of rational number</li>
</ul>
<li>Outputs:</li>
<ul><li>None</li></ul>
</ul>
</td></tr>
</table>

<H2>Hints</H2>
<ul>

  <li>Consider carefully when you want to use GCD.  The library primarily uses
  it to simplify a rational number as much as possible BEFORE storing it to
  the stack.  If you choose to do this elsewhere, and mix functions with the
  Library, don't be surprised if some fractions display in other than
  lowest-terms.</li>

  <li>The libmp2 file contains executable library functions 
  for each of the routines that you need to implement. This allows you to run 
  the program and understand how it works before you implement it. You can test 
  your program by stepping through&nbsp;it and making sure the display and 
  comparison functions work correctly. You will only receive credit, however, 
  for the routines that you implement yourself. </li>

  <li>When debugging your code in Turbo Debugger, you will 
  find it helpful to use the memory window to show you the memory location of 
  the file and strings. You can also use the watch window to keep track of 
  variables in your code. </li>

  <li>Run the program many times to get a good feel of 
  it.&nbsp; Your final program with your code should resemble our version.&nbsp; 
  Formatting aesthetics aren't as important as correctly operating code. </li>

  <li>Do not forget to push and pop to avoid clobbering 
  registers! </li>

  <li>Push and Pop can also be used on memory, as long as 
  you specify the size and it's word-sized or larger. You don't have to move it 
  into a register first. (Yes, this does appear to break the two-memory access 
  rule. Don't worry!) </li>

  <li>Remember to include function headers for&nbsp;and 
  write comments in each of your functions!&nbsp; Headers should give a general 
  idea of what the function does and have a list of inputs, outputs, and called 
  functions.&nbsp; Commenting should be specific enough to allow a function to 
  be understood by just reading the comments.&nbsp; Commenting every line, 
  however, is excessive and may cost you some points. </li>

  <li>START EARLY! </li>

  <li>Monitor the <A href="news:uiuc.class.ece291">newsgroup</a> for
clarifications and help.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You will begin this MP with the following files:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>MP2.ASM</tt>: Program Framework
    <li><tt>Makefile</tt>: Specifies how and when programs are assembled and
    linked.
    <li><tt>libmp2.lib</tt>: Library functions for MP2
    <li><tt>lib291.lib</tt>: General-purpose library functions </li></ul>
  <li>You may copy these files from the network drive to your home directory
  with the following command: <br><tt>xcopy /s V:\ece291\mp2 W:\mp2</tt><br>or
  download the files from this server as <A href="mp2.zip">mp2.zip</A>
  <li>Add your code to <tt>MP2.ASM</tt>.
  <li>Assemble and link your program by typing<br><tt>make</tt><br>This command
  reads <em>Makefile</em> then invokes NASM and LINK to build an executable
  program.
  <li>Use Turbo Debugger (TD) to find and correct program errors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Steps</h2>
<ol>

  <li>Demonstrate your MP2.EXE to a TA. You may be asked to 
  recompile and demo the program. Your program must work with all given input.</li>

  <li>Be prepared to answer questions about any aspect of the operation
  of your program. The TAs will not accept an MP if you cannot fully
  explain the operation of your code and the details of your
  implementation. Delayed MPs will be subject to late penalties as
  described in the course syllabus (15pts/day).</li>

  <li>The TA will handin your MP online.</li>
